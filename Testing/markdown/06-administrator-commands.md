Title: Administrator commands
Subtitle: The 23 verbs an administrator account gets above a programmer, and how to use them.

An administrator account receives everything a programmer account does, plus
the 23 verbs below. In OpenQM most of these lived in `SYSTEM` and you reached
them by being there; in SD Core they are in the administrator's **own** account
VOC, so an SD administrator no longer has to `logto sdsys` to administer
anything.

**Being an SD administrator means being an elevated Windows administrator.**
There is no SD password that confers it. Several of these verbs check for
elevation and say so rather than failing obscurely — see
[Security](12-security.html).

## Accounts

```
create.account  user <name> {administrator | programmer} <ssh|api|both|none>
create.account  group <name>
delete.account  <name>
modify.account  <name> <standard | programmer | administrator | suspended>
modify.account  <name> <ssh|api|both|none>
modify.account  <name> <sh-on | sh-off | os-on | os-off>
modify.account  add <group> <user>
update.account
clean.account
```

Covered in full in [Account types](05-account-types.html). The points worth
repeating here:

- **One of `ssh`, `api`, `both`, `none` is required** on `create.account user`.
  There is no default.
- **`modify.account` says what the access *is*, not what to add.**
  `modify.account fred api` takes ssh away. The tier keyword works the same way.
- **The tier can be changed after creation**, in either direction, and the VOC
  is rebuilt at once. `suspended` is a fourth tier that denies entry.
- **`update.account` only ever adds VOC records**, never removes them —
  `modify.account <tier>` is the only thing that removes one.
- **Nothing here changes an administrator's access.** ssh, the API and the
  operating system are all a rule for that tier; downgrade the account first.

**`clean.account`** tidies an account's workspace. **`update.account`** is the one you
run in each account after upgrading SD.

## Grants

```
grant       <account> to   <user>
revoke      <account> from <user>
list.grants <account>
```

All three need an elevated session.

***A GRANT OR A REVOKE DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE PERSON SIGNS OUT OF
WINDOWS AND BACK IN.*** Entry to an account is Windows group membership, and
Windows fixes that at logon. **Somebody you have just revoked keeps the account
until they get a new token.** Both verbs print the reminder every time.

## Passwords

```
modify.password {<account>}
```

**`set.password` was renamed to `modify.password`** — every account now has a
password from the moment it is created, so there is nothing to *set* for the
first time.

***A PASSWORD CANNOT BE TYPED ON THE COMMAND LINE.*** **`modify.password`** refuses
one given as an argument. A password on a command line is visible to any local
user through Task Manager or `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`, so SD prompts for
it instead, masked.

The password matters for **API logins only**. Console and ssh logins ask for
nothing — see [Security](12-security.html).

## Locks and sessions

```
lock / unlock
list.locks / clear.locks
listu / list.readu
logout
```

***`unlock` is the one to know about.*** It clears a record lock left behind by
a session that died holding one. Without it the only way to release such a lock
is to stop and restart SD, which disconnects everybody.

> An earlier changelog entry claimed **`unlock`** had never worked on any release
> this port was built from, because its VOC entry carried description text in
> the type field. **That conclusion was wrong and has been withdrawn.** SD
> allows a type code followed immediately by comment text — the same rule PI,
> PI/open and UniVerse follow — so `Verb to unlock records` reads as type `V`
> with a comment, and **`unlock`** dispatched normally all along. The record has
> been rewritten as a bare `V` for consistency, and behaves no differently.
> **`copyp`** carried the same style of entry and was likewise working.

**`listu`** and **`list.readu`** report sessions and read locks; **`logout`** ends another
session.

## System state

```
config
set.date
```

**`config`** reports the configuration parameters in force.

> **`CREATUSR` is gone.** **`config`** no longer lists it and `config('CREATUSR')`
> returns nothing. A `CREATUSR` line in `sd.conf` is still accepted and
> ignored, so a configuration file brought from a Linux install still works.
> You can delete the line.

## The shell escapes — `sh` and `!`

***WHO MAY USE `sh` IS A LIST YOU KEEP, NOT A MATTER OF ELEVATION.***

This is one of the larger behavioural changes in the port. In earlier builds of
it **`sh`** required an elevated session — and **an ssh session can never be
elevated**, so programmers, the people who actually need a shell, were the ones
who could never have one.

### The list

One record per person, **keyed by the name they sign in with, not by the
account name**. The login name follows the person, so it does not change when
they **`logto`** somewhere else.

### How you grant it

**Four keywords on `modify.account` do it without your editing anything:**

```
modify.account fred sh-on      the sh verb and ! at the prompt
modify.account fred sh-off
modify.account fred os-on      OS.EXECUTE, and the edit and micro editors
modify.account fred os-off
```

`create.account` takes the two `on` forms. **They are four switches over two
fields**, not four names for one state, so `sh-off` leaves `OS.EXECUTE` alone —
and the verb prints the resulting record, both fields, every time.

***AN ADMINISTRATOR-TIER ACCOUNT GETS BOTH FIELDS WITHOUT BEING ASKED***,
including the account the installer makes for whoever installs SD. That is why
an administrator reaches the editors and the shell from an ordinary,
unelevated session.

**And the four keywords refuse an administrator, in both directions:**

```
:modify.account don os-off
don is an administrator and always reaches the operating system
```

An administrator has all three routes — ssh, the API and the operating system —
as a rule. Downgrade the account first if that is really what you want.

### Or edit the record by hand

The record is ordinary data. From an **elevated** session, because the file is
writable only by an administrator:

```
logto sdsys
ed os.users don
```

The record is two lines and nothing else. To give `don` the shell and the
editors:

```
yes
yes
```

In **`ed`**: `i` to insert, type the two lines, a full stop on its own line to
stop inserting, then `fi` to file and exit. **Field 1 is `SH`, field 2 is
`OS.EX`** — the order matters and there is nothing else in the record.

| What you want `don` to have | Field 1 | Field 2 |
|---|---|---|
| nothing outside SD | *no record at all* | |
| the editors, but no shell at the prompt | anything but `yes` | `yes` |
| a shell, but programs may not shell out | `yes` | anything but `yes` |
| both | `yes` | `yes` |

**`don` is the Windows login name, not the SD account name.** They are usually
the same; where they are not, this file wants the one the person signs in with.

***THE CHANGE TAKES EFFECT ON THEIR NEXT COMMAND***, not at their next login —
the list is read when the shell or the editor is asked for.

**To take it away, set the field to anything else or delete the record.**
Deleting the record removes both.

| Field | Controls | Value |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SH` — a shell at the command prompt | `yes`, or anything else for no |
| 2 | `OS.EX` — `OS.EXECUTE` from inside a program, **and the `edit` and `micro` editors** | `yes`, or anything else for no |

***FIELD 2 IS WHAT LETS A PROGRAMMER USE THE FULL-SCREEN EDITORS.*** They run
an editor outside SD, so they are reaching the operating system whatever the
VOC tier says. A programmer with the verb and no `yes` in field 2 is told the
command is not available and what to ask for — see
[Programmer commands](07-programmer-commands.html#both-editors-need-osexecute-permission-as-well-as-the-verb).

**A missing record, or a missing file, means no.** An installation that has
never set `os.users` up denies both to ordinary accounts.

***ONE CASE HAND-EDITING IS THE ONLY WAY OUT OF.*** An account promoted to
administrator gets both fields written; an account that was *adopted* over a
Windows login which already had a record saying `no` **keeps that record**, and
because the four keywords refuse an administrator, no verb can then change it.
`ed os.users <name>` is the way out. It is rare, and it is the reason this
section still documents the file rather than only the keywords.

### Both fields are enforced

`OS.EXECUTE` used to be unchecked entirely, so **any account that could write a
program had the operating system** and the **`sh`** restriction could be walked
around by anyone able to type BASIC. Field 2 is now what decides whether
`OS.EXECUTE` may run. The refusal reads *`<name>` is not permitted to use
OS.EXECUTE*.

The two fields are independent, and the useful combination is the third row:

```
unlisted            sh refused    OS.EXECUTE refused
SH=yes OS.EX=no     sh RUNS       OS.EXECUTE refused
SH=no  OS.EX=yes    sh refused    OS.EXECUTE RUNS      <- programs may shell
                                                          out; the person at
                                                          the prompt may not
elevated            sh runs       OS.EXECUTE RUNS
```

SD's own system programs are exempt, so **`create.account`** and the **`sh`** verb work
as before.

### Three rules that go with it

***ONLY AN ADMINISTRATOR CAN EDIT THE LIST.*** `os.users` is read-only to
everybody else on disk, and **that ACL is the whole of what stops a user
granting themselves a shell. Do not loosen those permissions.**

**A listed person gets a real shell** — pipes, redirection and chaining all
work: `sh dir | more`. Anyone not on the list who reaches **`sh`** by being
elevated still gets the restricted form, which rejects those characters.

**An elevated session keeps `sh` whatever the list says**, deliberately, so an
empty list cannot lock the machine's own administrator out.

### Neither is available over the API

**`sh`** and `OS.EXECUTE` are refused to a session that arrived over the API.
**Before this port they were not**, and on Windows that was worse than it
sounds: in earlier builds of this port they ran **as the LocalSystem account**,
so a remote client could run any command on the machine with full privilege —
more than the administrator at the keyboard gets. An API session is no longer
treated as an administrator for any purpose.

## The full list of the 20

**`create.account`** · **`delete.account`** · **`modify.account`** · **`update.account`** ·
**`clean.account`** · **`grant`** · **`revoke`** · **`list.grants`** · **`unlock`** ·
**`modify.password`** · **`config`** · **`listu`** · **`list.readu`** ·
**`list.locks`** · **`clear.locks`** · **`lock`** · **`logout`** · **`set.date`** · **`sh`** · `!`

> **Twelve of these left `NEWVOC` on 24 Aug 2026** — **`config`**, **`listu`**,
> **`list.readu`**, **`list.locks`**, **`clear.locks`**, **`lock`**, **`logout`**, **`set.date`**,
> **`sh`**, `!`, **`clean.account`** and `umask`. They are no longer copied into any
> account's VOC; administrators receive them from `VOC_TEMPLATE` instead. **A
> programmer or standard account created before that update keeps whichever of
> them it had**, because **`update.account`** never removes a record.

> **`umask` was removed from every tier.** It controls POSIX file-mode bits,
> which Windows does not use for security — all file access runs through the
> ACLs an SD account already receives. Setting a umask on Windows produces no
> security effect and would only be misleading. The record types stay compiled,
> but no VOC in any tier dispatches to them.
