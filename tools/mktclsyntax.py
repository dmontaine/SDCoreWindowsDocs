# Write the SD TCL syntax card from tools/tcl-syntax-shapes.txt, and REFUSE to
# write it if a single verb has no line - the same contract mksyntax.py has for
# the SD BASIC card.
#
# THE ROSTER IS COMPUTED, NEVER TYPED.  143 verbs = the 123 verb records in
# sdsys/newvoc plus the 20 named in newvoc/TIER.ADD.ADMINISTRATOR, asserted not
# to overlap.  It was 144 and 21 until encrypt.field left the tier list
# (PRE_RELEASE 25).  THE ROSTER FOLLOWED ON ITS OWN because it is computed; the
# shapes file did not, and the "not a verb" refusal below is what that is for.
# A VOC record is a verb if the first character of field 1 is V,
# or - for the four records that are a keyword AND a verb, which CPROC
# re-parses from field 3 - the first character of field 3 is V.  Dispatch comes
# from field 2, or field 4 for those four.
#
# ***THE START-DESCRIPTION BLOCKS ARE A CONTROL, NOT A SOURCE.***  Sixty-three
# of the ninety-seven catalogued verbs carry one.  They are not used as content:
# they are written in another notation and several are stale.  Instead this
# script reports where the shapes file and a START-DESCRIPTION disagree about
# which KEYWORDS a verb takes.  Every hit is a lead for a person to follow -
# either the card is wrong or the source comment is - and it is printed rather
# than acted on, because a script cannot tell which.
#
# It also cross-checks the tier of every verb, so the card cannot disagree with
# what the account actually gets.
