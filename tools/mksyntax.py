# Build TWO pages that partition every name BCOMP accepts:
#
#   User 18       SD Basic - Syntax, one alphabetical run of everything an
#                 application may use, syntax only.
#   Technical 01  SD Basic - Restricted Commands, the ones it may not -
#                 restricted statements, internal-only functions, and the
#                 names that are in a table with no opcode behind them.
#
# The split is the owner's ruling of 26 Aug 2026.  The script checks that the
# two pages partition the roster, so a name cannot fall down the gap.
#
# WHY IT IS GENERATED.  The card's whole value is that every name is on it.  A
# hand-written list of four hundred entries is a list with omissions nobody
# notices, so the roster comes from BCOMP's own tables and this script REFUSES
# to write the page if any name lacks a line.  The same reason docmap.py
# exists, one level down: docmap says each name is described somewhere, this
# says each name is looked up here.
#
# WHERE THE SYNTAX COMES FROM, said plainly because it is not all one thing:
#
#   * ARGUMENT COUNTS FOR FUNCTIONS ARE MECHANICAL.  BCOMP dispatches each
#     intrinsic to an argument handler through an "on i goto" list that is
#     POSITIONAL against the name list, and each entry carries the name in a
#     trailing comment.  So the count can be read off, and the comment is a
#     free alignment control - this script asserts the two lists are the same
#     length and that every comment matches its name.  If BCOMP is edited and
#     the two drift apart, this stops rather than emitting a wrong card.
#
#   * EVERYTHING ELSE IS IN syntax-shapes.txt, one NAME = syntax per line.
#     Statements have clauses rather than argument lists, and functions whose
#     handler is a special case (CSVDQ, OPEN.SOCKET, SYSMSG and about twenty
#     more) have shapes the count cannot express.  Those lines were taken from
#     documents 01 to 17, where they were measured, and from BCOMP's own
#     statement compilers where no page covers them.
#
# The data file wins wherever both have an opinion, so a measured shape always
# beats a derived one.

CARD_HEAD = u"""Title: SD Basic - Syntax
Subtitle: Every statement and function, alphabetically, with its syntax and nothing else.

A lookup card, and nothing else. If you know what you want and have forgotten
how to spell it, it is here. If you want to know what it *does*, the other
seventeen documents in this set are where that lives.

*Italics* mark something you supply, **bold** a word typed as it stands, and
braces an optional part. SD folds case, so any of this may be written in
either case.

> **This page is generated, and it is checked for completeness rather than
> proof-read for it.** The roster comes from `BCOMP`'s own tables — the same
> extraction the rest of this set uses — and `tools/mksyntax.py` refuses to
> write the page if a single name that belongs on it has no line. Argument
> counts for functions are read out of `BCOMP`'s dispatch table, which is
> positional against the name list and carries each name in a comment; the
> script asserts the two agree before it uses either. The shapes that a count
> cannot express — every statement, and about twenty functions — come from
> documents 01 to 17, where they were measured.

***WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHERE IT WENT.*** Everything on this card is
something an application may use. Names that an ordinary program **cannot**
compile are in the Technical set, under *SD Basic - Restricted Commands*: the
restricted statements, the internal-only functions, and the one name that is
in the compiler's table with nothing behind it. **If you are looking for
something and it is not here, that is where to look before concluding it does
not exist.**

***ONE THING IS MARKED, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT WASTES TIME.***

| | |
|---|---|
| ***(clause word)*** | not a statement — a word that belongs inside another one's syntax |

TECH_HEAD = u"""Title: SD Basic - Restricted Commands
Subtitle: The statements and functions an ordinary program cannot compile, and what the compiler says when it tries.

This is a Technical document. Nothing on this page is available to an
application: every name here needs a program compiled with `$internal`, which
in turn needs an administrator in the `SDSYS` account. They are listed because
they exist, because they appear in SD's own source, and because the errors
they produce name something other than the real cause.

## The three kinds, and how each one fails

| | |
|---|---|
| ***(restricted)*** | a statement in `BCOMP`'s `restricted.statements`. An ordinary account gets ***"Unrecognised statement"***, which at least names the right line |
| ***(internal)*** | a function in `BCOMP`'s `int.intrinsics`. ***The message names something else entirely***: an unknown function is read as a matrix reference, so the complaint is ***"Matrix X is not referenced in a DIM statement"*** — reported at the **last line of the program**, nowhere near the call. With three or more arguments it is *"Right bracket not found where expected"* instead, because a matrix takes at most two subscripts |
| ***(no such thing)*** | in a table with no opcode behind it. It compiles for **nobody** — `$internal` does not help |

***THE SECOND ROW IS THE ONE TO REMEMBER.*** If a function you are certain
exists produces a complaint about a `dim` statement you never wrote, it does
exist, and this account may not call it.

**`$internal` needs both halves.** `BCOMP` tests
`kernel(K$INTERNAL, -1) and kernel(K$ADMINISTRATOR, -1)` — internal mode alone
was enough until 13 Aug 2026, and it was not safe: internal programs are the
only ones that may set the administrator flag, and `sd -internal` is not itself
gated, so any account could have compiled a three-line program that granted
itself administrator rights. That was demonstrated, not theorised.
