# sdtcl.ps1 - run TCL commands in a real SD session and print what came back.
# This is how the measured listings in the SD TCL document set were produced:
# type the claim as a command, run it, and quote what SD said.
#
# USAGE
#     sdtcl.ps1 -Commands 'list voc sample 3','count voc'
#     sdtcl.ps1 -File commands.txt [-Account don] [-TimeoutSec 90] [-Raw]
#
# WHY IT EXISTS.  sdprobe.ps1 runs a BASIC probe; there was nothing for a TCL
# command, and the TCL pages need their examples run before they are written
# down.
#
# WHY 'don' AND NOT SDSYS, WHICH IS THE SAME REASON sdprobe.ps1 GIVES AND ONE
# MORE.  A user account needs no elevation.  LOGTO SDSYS does: CPROC's
# logto.authorised admits an already-elevated session, an internal one, or one
# that has JUST OBTAINED privilege - and that last route asks UAC, so every run
# against SDSYS puts a consent prompt in front of whoever is at the machine.
# Six runs, six prompts, and the person clicking them is not necessarily the
# person who started the script.  THE GROUP FALLBACK DOES NOT HELP: the SDSYS
# register entry names a group 'sdsys' that does not exist on Windows.
# Measure in a user account unless the thing being measured is SDSYS.
#
# THE SHAPE IS PROJECT_STATUS section 6's: a whole script ending in OFF, fed
# down a pipe under Start-Job with a timeout, with a blank sacrificial first
# line to absorb the pipe's BOM.  A bare "echo CMD | sd" hangs the session and
# leaves a stray sd.exe that costs an elevation to clear.
#
# IT REFUSES A RUN THAT MEASURED NOTHING.  An empty transcript, or fewer
# command echoes than commands sent, and it says so - an empty transcript
# scored against a set of patterns produces tidy negatives that look like
# findings.
#
# ***THE TIMEOUT PATH COSTS THE INSTALL, NOT JUST THE RUN.  AVOID REACHING
# IT.***  Killing the job kills the sd session, and PROJECT_STATUS.md is
# explicit: "never Stop-Process an sd session on a tree you still want to
# measure."  The dead session keeps its user-table slot; nothing reaps it
# without elevation; LOGOUT n only marks it "(logout pending)" because logout
# signals a process that is gone; and sdwind's five-minute check_lost_users()
# sweep has been observed answering every NEW session "Forced logout" for
# twenty minutes.  Recovery is elevated: sd -cleanup, then a service restart
# if that does not take.
#
# SO THE RULE IS PREVENTION, AND IT IS ONE RULE: NEVER SEND A COMMAND THAT CAN
# PROMPT.  A prompt eats the following lines as its answers and the session
# then waits for ever.  COPY prompts when a select list is active - give it
# explicit record ids, or NO.QUERY.  CREATE.FILE, DELETE.FILE and DELETE all
# take NO.QUERY.  SAVE.LIST and GET.LIST prompt when the name is omitted.
# If a verb has a confirmation, supply the switch that suppresses it.
