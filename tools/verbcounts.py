# verbcounts.py <sd4windows>/sdb_ai/sd64/sdsys/newvoc
#
# Compute the number of VERBS each account tier gets, then check every verb
# count written in prose across all four document sets against it.
#
# ***WHY IT EXISTS - PRE_RELEASE 80, ITEM (a).***  "Nothing compares the prose
# figures against the generated roster."  mktclsyntax.py printed standard 81 in
# the generated card for a week while the tester set said 77; the two halves of
# the documentation disagreed and nothing noticed, because the generators read
# the VOC and the hand-written pages do not.
#
# ***IT IS A VERB COUNT AND NOT A RECORD COUNT, AND CONFLATING THEM IS THE
# TRAP.***  gplbld/verify-tiers.ps1 measures VOC RECORDS - 420 administrator,
# 397 programmer, 355 standard - and those are the right numbers for that
# instrument, because "count voc" is exact and arithmetic.  A reader of the
# documentation wants to know how many COMMANDS they can type, which is the
# subset of those records that are verbs.  The two are different numbers and
# neither is wrong.  Do not "correct" one to the other.
#
# THE RULE FOR WHAT IS A VERB is tclmap.py's, deliberately, so the two cannot
# disagree: field 1 begins V, or - for the records that are a keyword AND a
# verb - field 3 does.
#
# HOW THE PROSE CHECK WORKS.  Every "<n> verbs" in the markdown is found and
# required to be one of the computed figures, or to be registered in ALLOWED
# below with a reason.  A figure nobody can account for is the defect this
# exists to catch.  The pattern is deliberately narrow; see the note above it.
#
# EXITS NON-ZERO on a prose figure that matches no computed count and is not
# registered, or on a roster that came out empty.
