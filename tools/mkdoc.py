# mkdoc.py - render documentation Markdown to single-file HTML
#
# command line: python3 gplbld/mkdoc.py --in DIR|FILE... --out DIR
# eg  python gplbld/mkdoc.py --in docs/sample --out docs/sample
#
# NOTHING CALLS THIS YET, DELIBERATELY.  It is not wired into stage.py or
# sd.iss, because naming a .md in either of those files is what makes
# assert-current watch it (the $shipsAs valve, assert-current.ps1:484), and
# from that moment every documentation edit demands a full cycle before any
# verifier will run.  That is correct once the documentation ships; it is a
# toll nobody should pay while the format is still being judged.  See
# HISTORY.md, "20 Aug 2026 - assert-current demanded a full cycle for a
# markdown file".
#
# WHY HTML AT ALL, AND WHY ONE FILE.  Every Windows machine has a browser, so
# there is nothing to install and no format to explain.  Embedding the CSS
# means there is no asset folder to break, no relative path to get wrong when
# the file is copied off the machine, and nothing to fetch - which matters
# because SD installs on machines that are not on the internet.  The user
# prints to PDF from the browser, so no PDF ships, which the no-binaries rule
# in CLAUDE.md forbids anyway.
#
# WHY A LIBRARY RATHER THAN A HAND-ROLLED CONVERTER.  Markdown looks trivial
# until the first nested list inside a table cell.  python-markdown is pure
# Python, so it installs with pip and adds no binary dependency - which is why
# pandoc was rejected despite being the better converter.
#
# THE CSS IS THE POINT OF THIS SCRIPT, not the conversion.  What makes
# technical documentation look like documentation rather than a rendered
# README is a short list, and it is all here: a measure capped near 72
# characters, a system font stack with no web fonts to fetch or license, real
# table and code-block styling, a table of contents with anchors, and a print
# stylesheet so browser-to-PDF comes out clean.

# ***THE SCREEN NOW LOOKS LIKE THE PDF.  OWNER'S INSTRUCTION, 5 September
# 2026:*** "Change the formatting of the html pages to look as much like the
# pdfs as possible, no side bar.  Allow the user to navigate forward and
# backward through the pages using controls at both the top and bottom of the
# pages."
#
# WHAT THAT MEANT IN PRACTICE was mostly promoting the @media print block to
# the default rules rather than writing new ones - black on white, one column,
# no sidebar, no masthead - because the browser IS the PDF exporter, so that
# block already WAS the PDF's appearance.  What is left in @media print below
# is only the part that is genuinely print-only: point sizes, page breaks, and
# hiding the navigation controls.
#
# THE DARK PALETTE IS GONE, DELIBERATELY.  A PDF has one appearance and the
# instruction was to match it.  A page that is grey-on-black on one machine and
# black-on-white on another is not "as much like the pdf as possible" on the
# first machine.
#
# THE SIDEBAR TABLE OF CONTENTS IS GONE, AND SPLITTING THE LONG PAGES IS WHAT
# PAID FOR IT.  Dropping it means a reader moves between pages rather than
# within one, which is only tolerable if no page is twenty screens long.  See
# README.md, "A number with a letter after it is the second half of a long
# page": fourteen pages were cut in two in the same change.
#
# THE MEASURE IS THE PRINTED PAGE'S, NOT THE BROWSER'S.  The sheet is sized so
# a line of prose runs about as long as it does in the PDF.  Tables and code
# blocks get the full sheet, because a keyword table squeezed into prose width
# wraps in every cell and a syntax line that wraps stops being a syntax line.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The title page.
#
# WHY IT IS GENERATED HERE RATHER THAN WRITTEN INTO EACH MARKDOWN FILE.  There
# are fifty-three documents in the User set alone.  A copyright line pasted into
# each one is fifty-three places to update when the year, the licence or the
# release changes, and fifty-three chances for one of them to say something
# different from the rest.  The Markdown supplies the two things that differ
# per document - Title and Subtitle - and everything else comes from here.
#
# ***THE LICENCE BLOCK CAME OFF EVERY PAGE ON 5 September 2026.  OWNER, LOOKING
# AT A PDF:*** "You can remove this header (shown in the pdf) from every page.
# It should be available once for each set of documents: user, administrator and
# getting started.  After that a tag line at the bottom of each page should
# contain the copyright notices and the license name."
#
# So a page's own header is now the product line, the title and the subtitle,
# and nothing else; the copyright and the licence NAME are the footer tag line
# on every page; and the full block - the metadata table and the three-paragraph
# summary with the licence URL - is rendered ONCE PER SET, into whichever page
# carries the <!--LICENCE-BLOCK--> marker.  That is
# 00a-copyright-and-licence.md in each of the three sets.
#
# ***IT IS STILL GENERATED, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT.***  Writing the block into
# three markdown files instead of one template would be three places to update
# rather than fifty-three, which is better and is still wrong.  The marker keeps
# one copy of the words here and lets the set decide where it appears.
# add_nav.py asserts that EXACTLY ONE page per set carries it, so it can neither
# go missing nor appear twice.
#
# THE COVER IS NO LONGER A PAGE OF ITS OWN.  It used to break after itself so
# that browser-to-PDF gave a real page 1.  With the licence block gone it is
# three lines, and a whole sheet holding three lines is not a cover, it is a
# gap.  It now sits at the top of the first page with the two-line gap below it
# that the same instruction asked for.

# THE TWO MARKERS ARE WHERE add_nav.py PUTS THE PREV/NEXT BARS, and they are
# comments rather than an anchor guessed from the markup.  add_nav runs AFTER
# mkpdf, deliberately, so the bars are not in the PDFs; that means mkdoc cannot
# write them itself, and add_nav needs somewhere reliable to put them.  Both
# scripts REFUSE a page missing either marker rather than inserting one bar and
# reporting two.
#
# THE BOTTOM MARKER SITS BEFORE <footer>, NOT INSIDE IT.  add_nav used to
# insert before </footer>, which put the page controls UNDERNEATH the copyright
# line - the last thing on the page was the licence and the reader had to scroll
# back up past it to find "Next".
#
# THE MASTHEAD AND THE SIDEBAR ARE GONE.  Both were hidden in @media print
# already, which is to say neither was ever in the PDF; the 5 September 2026
# instruction was to make the screen match, so they are no longer emitted at
# all rather than emitted and hidden.
#
# THE FOOTER IS INSIDE .page NOW.  It used to sit outside, so on screen it was
# a strip below the sheet - and add_nav inserts the bottom bar before
# </footer>, which would have put the page controls off the paper.
#
# ***THE FOOTER IS THE TAG LINE THE OWNER ASKED FOR, AND "Generated from
# <file>.md" HAS GONE FROM IT.***  It is the only place the copyright and the
# licence name now appear on an ordinary page, so it carries both and nothing
# else.  The source file name was the one thing on it a reader could not use.
