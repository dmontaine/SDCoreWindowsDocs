#
# Assign every CONFIGURATION PARAMETER to exactly one document, check the
# document actually documents it, and - the half that matters for W1.0-0 -
# report which parameters are still READ by the product and which survive only
# as a branch that accepts a value nothing consumes.
#
# ***WHY IT EXISTS.***  docmap.py does this for the SD BASIC roster and
# tclmap.py for the TCL verbs.  Nothing did it for sd.conf, and the gap showed:
# the configuration page listed 19 parameters and named one, PTYPES, that does
# not exist, while config.c parses 52.  A page written from another product's
# documentation cannot be checked by reading it.
#
# ***AND IT ANSWERS THE OWNER'S SECOND DIRECTIVE, 4 Sep 2026 - "there may be new
# features that are not documented".***  A checker that only asked "is every
# documented parameter real" would have passed a page listing three parameters.
# The roster is computed from the source, so a parameter added to config.c
# turns this red until somebody writes it down.
#
# ***THE INERT TEST IS THE POINT, NOT A BONUS.***  Owner, 4 Sep 2026: "some of
# those config settings may have been for features removed such as qmnet (sdnet)
# and PROCS ... do not include documentation for features the source code no
# longer supports."  A parameter whose struct field is written by config.c and
# read by nothing else is a parameter that does nothing.  It must still be
# DOCUMENTED - a site with it in sd.conf needs to know - but documented as
# accepted and inert, never as a control.
#
# HOW THE INERT TEST WORKS.  A parameter has TWO ways of being read and the
# first draft of this script knew only one, which is why the comment below is
# longer than the code.
#
#   1. THE C SIDE.  config.c assigns the value to a struct member; a .c file
#      outside config.c and op_config.c mentions that member.
#   2. ***THE BASIC SIDE, WHICH IS THE ONE THAT WAS MISSED.***  gpl.bp reads the
#      value back through the config() function by NAME - CREATEF:359 takes
#      GRPSIZE, CREATEA:391 takes USRDIR, _VOC_REF:131 takes FILERULE.  None of
#      those touches the struct member, so a C-only test calls all three inert.
#
# ***THE FIRST VERSION DID EXACTLY THAT AND WOULD HAVE PRINTED IT.***  It named
# nine parameters inert, three of them being GRPSIZE, GRPDIR and USRDIR - the
# default group size and the two directories every account is created in.  A
# page saying those do nothing would have been worse than the page that omitted
# them.  The check was widened rather than the finding trusted.
#
# WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE: a member reached only through a macro, or a config()
# call built from a variable rather than a literal.  So the script REPORTS the
# readers rather than deciding, and anything it calls inert is confirmed by
# reading the sources before a page repeats it.
#
# EXITS NON-ZERO on: a parameter assigned nowhere, assigned twice, assigned to a
# page that does not evidence it, an assignment naming a parameter that is not
# in config.c, or a roster that came out empty.
