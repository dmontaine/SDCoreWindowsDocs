"""mkbook.py - assemble one HTML "book" per set, for a single merged PDF.

    python tools\\mkbook.py --set Administrator --out Administrator\\book.html

WHY THIS EXISTS.  The release ships PDF only, and 86 separate PDFs is not a
document - it is a pile of fragments with no continuous page numbers, no
outline, and no search across a set.  Owner's ruling, 6 Sep 2026: "merge per
set".  So each set becomes ONE PDF with a bookmark tree and running page
numbers.

THE FOOTER PROBLEM THIS ALSO SOLVES, and it is the reason the per-page footer
is STRIPPED here rather than kept.  An HTML <footer> is an in-flow block: it
renders once, at the end of the last page's content, so in a printed document
it is either invisible or - as the owner photographed on 6 Sep 2026 - orphaned
alone on a sheet of its own.  A running footer cannot be made from HTML in
Chromium at all: CSS Paged Media margin boxes (@page { @bottom-center }) are
the standard way and Chromium has never implemented them.  The ONLY mechanism
is printToPDF's footerTemplate, which is page furniture rather than content and
therefore cannot be orphaned, split or covered.  mkbookpdf.ps1 supplies it.

So the copyright appears ONCE, in this book's front matter, and the running
strip is drawn by the printer.

THE OUTLINE IS NOT BUILT HERE EITHER.  printToPDF's generateDocumentOutline
derives it from the heading elements, and every page already carries an
<h1 class="tp-title">.  Keeping the h1s intact is what makes the bookmark tree,
so nothing here may demote them.

WHAT IT REFUSES.  A set with no pages, a page whose shape does not match what
mkdoc.py emits, and a set whose pages disagree about the stylesheet - all three
would otherwise produce a book that renders and is quietly wrong.
