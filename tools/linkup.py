# Turn *SD Basic - X* into a real link, but ONLY for pages that exist.  A
# reference to a document not yet written stays in italics, so the link checker
# stays meaningful and nobody ships a link to a 404.
#
# It reports what it changed and what it left alone, and refuses to write if it
# changed nothing - a substitution that silently matches nothing is the usual
# way this kind of script looks like it worked.
