Title: Running SD
Subtitle: The service, starting and stopping, and what to do when the last shutdown was not a clean one.

***SD IS A WINDOWS SERVICE AND IT IS ALREADY RUNNING.*** Nobody types
`sd -start` any more.

| | |
|---|---|
| Display name | **String Database (SD)** |
| Service name | `SD` |
| Start type | automatic — Windows starts it at every boot |
| Created by | the installer, which also starts it |
| Removed by | the uninstaller |

This is a change from the Linux original, where `sd -start` had to be typed
after every restart.

## Starting and stopping

**Stopping the service stops SD and ends every session on the machine**, which
is exactly what `sd -stop` has always done. Either is fine:

```
Stop-Service SD
Start-Service SD
```

```
sd -stop
sd -start
```

## `sd -start` and `sd -stop` tell the truth now

Both used to answer from the **shared memory segment**, which outlives the
daemon — so both could report success while doing nothing. Four things changed,
and each is a state you may hit while testing.

***"SD is already started" IS NOW ONLY SAID WHEN THE DAEMON REALLY IS
RUNNING***, and it tells you the process id — the Windows one, the number Task
Manager and `Stop-Process` use.

***IF THE SEGMENT IS THERE BUT THE DAEMON IS NOT — what a killed or crashed SD
leaves behind — `sd -start` says so and tells you to run `sd -stop` first.***
It used to say *"SD is already started"* and do nothing, **leaving the system
unusable while the command that would fix it reported success.**

It does **not** clear the wreckage for you: that would end any sessions still
attached to the segment. **The count of those is printed so you can decide.**

***`sd -stop` NOW CHECKS THAT THE DAEMON ACTUALLY STOPPED.*** A daemon started
from an elevated session cannot be stopped from an ordinary one — Windows
refuses the signal — and that used to be silent, leaving a daemon running
against a segment nothing else could see. You now get a warning naming the
process id and the command to stop it with.

## After an unclean shutdown

If SD is stopped abruptly — the power goes, or the process is killed — it
leaves a shared memory segment behind. ***ON WINDOWS THAT SURVIVES A REBOOT,
WHERE ON LINUX IT WOULD NOT.***

SD used to refuse to start on the next boot and say *"Run sd -stop to clear
it"*, so **the machine came up with SD unavailable to everybody** until
somebody logged in and typed it by hand.

Nothing from before a restart can still be using that segment, so SD now
discards it and starts normally, printing:

```
Discarding the shared segment left by the previous boot -
SD did not shut down cleanly.
```

***THIS CHANGES NOTHING WHILE THE MACHINE IS RUNNING.*** A segment belonging to
a live SD is still never touched, and `sd -start` still refuses to disturb a
system that is already up.

## SD will not start a second time inside itself

If you leave SD with `sh` and then type `sd` in that shell, it says so and
returns you to the session you already have.

Worth knowing alongside it: **`sh` itself needs either an elevated session or a
`yes` in `os.users`**, so an ordinary account cannot leave SD this way at all,
and one reached over ssh never can. See
[Administrator commands](03-administrator-commands.html#the-shell-escapes-sh-and).

## The command line

```
sd                  enter the SD account named after your Windows login
sd -a               prompt for an account
sd -a<name>         enter account <name>  -- refused unless it is your own
sd <command>        run one command       -- needs elevation, or batch.jobs
sd -quiet           suppress the displays on entry
sd -u               list current users
sd -k <n> | -k all  log out user n, or everybody
sd -start           start the system
sd -stop            stop the system
sd --version        report the version
sd --help           this summary
```

***THREE OF THESE BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT YOU MAY EXPECT.***

**`sd -a<name>` is refused unless `<name>` is your own account.** An
administrator no longer opens somebody else's account without ever being in
their own — they arrive in their own and reach the rest with `logto`, which is
where SD checks whether they are allowed in.

**`sd <command>` needs an elevated session**, or an entry for that account in
`batch.jobs`. That is what makes scheduled jobs possible without handing them
administrator rights — see
[Other hardening](09-hardening.html#scheduled-jobs).

**`sd <command>` no longer walks into a password prompt it cannot answer.** It
used to reach the *"needs a password"* prompt and block for ever on a read that
never got input, with nothing in any log because nothing had gone wrong from
SD's side.

## Where things are

| | |
|---|---|
| Binaries | `C:\Program Files\SD\usr\bin\` |
| The changelog | `C:\Program Files\SD\changelog` |
| Configuration | `C:\ProgramData\SD\sd.conf` |
| The database | `C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys\` |
| Accounts | `C:\ProgramData\SD\user_accounts\`, `...\group_accounts\` |
| Audit trail | `C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys\audit` |
| Error log | `C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys\errlog` |
| Elevation helper log | `C:\ProgramData\SD\sd-elevate.log` |

***DO NOT MOVE THE BINARIES.*** `usr\bin` is load-bearing: shipping
`msys-2.0.dll` beside the executable relocates the POSIX root to the DLL's
directory minus two components, and only that depth puts `/` on
`C:\Program Files\SD\`.

The DLLs ship beside `sd.exe` deliberately — Windows searches the executable's
own directory before `PATH`, which avoids Git for Windows's rival
`msys-2.0.dll` being picked up. **That failure makes SD report "SD has not been
started" while it is running**, which is worth recognising because it looks
like nothing else.
