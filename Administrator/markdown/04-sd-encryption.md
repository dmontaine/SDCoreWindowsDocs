Title: Encryption and the SDEXT interface
Subtitle: What libsodium provides, what an application can reach, and why field encryption has no key route in W1.0-0.

SD Core for Windows links libsodium and ships it as `libsodium-26.dll` beside
the server. Two things are built on it: the credential exchange that
authenticates an API login, and a pair of BASIC functions that encrypt and
decrypt a string.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown
here in lower case.

## The short version

An administrator reading this page usually wants one of two answers.

**For credentials**, nothing needs configuring. Passwords are never stored. SD
keeps a SCRAM-SHA-256 verifier in the credential store, the API login proves
knowledge of the password without sending it, and the primitives behind that
exchange are the ones listed further down.

**For encrypting application data**, W1.0-0 does not provide a usable route. The functions exist and work, but the only way to
produce a key they accept is an internal-only call. This is set out in full
under *Why field encryption is not available* below, because a site planning to
encrypt fields needs to know before it writes the application, not after.

## What was removed

| | |
|---|---|
| The `encrypt.field` verb | Removed. It pointed at a program, `$CRYPTO`, which never existed in the GPL release, so the verb could not have worked in any build derived from it |
| `encrypt()` and `decrypt()` | Removed upstream in July 2024 and replaced by `sdencrypt()` and `sddecrypt()`. The old names do not compile |
| The Python half of SDEXT | Removed with the embedded interpreter. The `SD_Py*` keys, `SDPYFUNC.H`, twenty `PY_*` programs and the object opcode all went. A program referencing a Python key does not compile, and the state it tested for cannot be reached |

## sdencrypt() and sddecrypt()

These are ordinary BASIC functions. Any account may compile a call to them.

```
sdencrypt(data, key, encoding)
sddecrypt(data, key, encoding)
```

Three arguments, not two. The third selects how the key is encoded and how the
result is returned:

| Encoding | Meaning | Key length required |
|---|---|---|
| `201` | hexadecimal | 64 characters |
| `202` | base64 | 44 characters |

The cipher is libsodium's authenticated `secretbox`, so the key is exactly
256 bits. The two lengths above are that key after encoding, and they are
checked exactly: a key of any other length is refused.

### Why field encryption is not available

A passphrase is not a key, and this is where a reader will otherwise lose a
day. Measured on W1.0-0:

```
sdencrypt('The quick brown fox', 'secretkey', 202)
```

returned nothing and set `status()` to **10204**, a key length error. `secretkey`
is nine characters and the function wanted 44.

The function that turns a password into a key of the right length is
`sdext()`'s `SD_KEYFROMPW`, and `sdext()` is internal-only — it needs a program
compiled with `$internal`, which needs an administrator working in the system
account. **So an ordinary program cannot obtain a key these functions will
accept, and there is no supported way in.**

An application that must encrypt data in W1.0-0 should do it outside SD, in the
client, and store the result as an ordinary string.

## The SDEXT interface

`sdext()` is the internal entry point to the cryptographic primitives.

```
rtnval = sdext(arg, isargmv, key)
```

`key` selects the operation, `arg` carries the arguments and `isargmv` says
whether `arg` holds several values rather than one.

**It cannot be called from an application.** `sdext` is in the compiler's
internal function table, so an ordinary account does not merely get refused —
it gets a misleading error. An unknown function is read as a matrix reference,
so the complaint is about a `dim` statement the program does not contain,
reported at the last line rather than at the call. That behaviour is covered by
[SD Basic - Restricted Commands](10-sd-basic-restricted-commands.html) in this
set.

`$internal` needs both halves: the compiler tests for internal mode **and** for
the administrator flag. Internal mode alone was enough until 13 August 2026 and
was not safe, because internal programs are the only ones that may set the
administrator flag.

### The keys

Ten are implemented. Every binary value is base64, because the interface
carries NUL-terminated strings and a raw 32-byte digest would contain a mark
character about one time in nine.

| Key | Value | Arguments | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SDEXT_TestIt` | 1 | any | Prints each argument and returns a count. A diagnostic |
| `SD_SALT` | 100 | none | A fresh salt, base64 |
| `SD_KEYFROMPW` | 101 | password, salt | A 256-bit key derived from the password |
| `SD_EUID_SET` | 102 | user name | Sets the process effective user and group |
| `SD_EUID_RESTORE` | 103 | none | Restores what they were on entry |
| `SD_SHA256` | 104 | one | SHA-256 of the argument |
| `SD_HMACSHA256` | 105 | base64 key, text message | HMAC-SHA256 |
| `SD_PBKDF2` | 106 | password, salt, iterations, length | Derived key |
| `SD_RANDBYTES` | 107 | count | Random bytes |
| `SD_XORBYTES` | 108 | two equal-length values | Their exclusive-or |
| `SD_CTEQUAL` | 109 | two values | `1` or `0`, compared in constant time |

`SD_CTEQUAL` reports a malformed argument as an error rather than as `0`,
because by the time the login path compares these values both sides are the
server's own — a decode failure there is a defect, not a wrong password. A
caller deciding whether to admit a login must still treat the error as a
refusal.

`SD_EUID_SET` and `SD_EUID_RESTORE` call the POSIX identity functions provided
by the server's runtime. They do not change the Windows process token, and SD's
own identity model does not use them.

### What uses it

Eight shipped programs call `sdext()`, and they are the whole of its use:
`APISRVR`, `CRED_SET`, `CRED_VERIFY`, `SD_GET_SALT`, `SD_KEY_FROM_PW`,
`SDCLIENT`, `EUID_SET` and `EUID_RESTORE`. Between them they set a credential,
verify one, and run the API's SCRAM exchange.

None of the eight is catalogued for general use, and none has a VOC entry, so
they are not an indirect route to the interface either.

## Two constants that are not SDEXT keys

`SD_ENCODEHX` (201) and `SD_ENCODE64` (202) are defined alongside the SDEXT
keys and are easily mistaken for them. They are not keys and `sdext()` does not
implement them — passing either as a key returns a key error. They are the
third argument to `sdencrypt()` and `sddecrypt()`, and they are documented
above.
