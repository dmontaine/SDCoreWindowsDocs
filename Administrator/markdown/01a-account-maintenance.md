Title: Account Maintenance
Subtitle: Emptying scratch files, refreshing a VOC, keeping local versions of records, configuration, the system date, and deleting an account.

This page continues [Accounts and Security](01-accounts-and-security.html).

## Emptying an account's scratch files: `clean.account`

```
clean.account
```

Empties three things in the account you are standing in, and takes no
arguments — **there is no way to clean an account you are not in**:

```
:clean.account
Cleaned $COMO
Cleaned $hold
Cleaned $savedlists
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **`$COMO`** | captured session transcripts, including every phantom's |
| **`$hold`** | reports sent to the hold file instead of a printer |
| **`$savedlists`** | saved select lists |

**Nothing else is touched** — no data file, no program, no dictionary. A como
capture that is currently running is left alone and says so: *$COMO not cleaned
- COMO file active*.

**It needs no elevation.** It is the one verb here an administrator account can
use from an ordinary session, which is right: it deletes only that account's own
scratch.

## Refreshing an account's VOC: `update.accounts`

```
update.accounts {all}
```

```
Copying records from NEWVOC to VOC...
```

Copies the shipped verb and keyword definitions into an account, adding what is
missing and leaving that account's own VOC entries alone. It is what brings an
existing account up to date after SD itself is upgraded, and **it respects the
account's tier** — a standard account does not collect programmer verbs by
being refreshed, and a suspended one keeps the tier it was suspended from.

With no keyword it updates the account you are standing in and then offers the
rest, asking each time. **`all` is the unattended form**: it updates every
registered account without asking.

You will not normally type `all` yourself. The installer runs it during an
upgrade, so a release that adds a VOC record reaches every existing account
without anybody visiting them. Before that existed, an upgrade replaced the
shipped files and no account gained a new verb.

`all` is an explicit keyword rather than something inferred from how SD was
started. The test for an internal session exists and would have worked, but it
would have decided a rewrite of every account's VOC from a property nobody
typing the verb can see.

A second word that is not `all` is refused by name rather than ignored:

```
:update.accounts everything
UPDATE.ACCOUNTS does not take everything
```

Quietly ignoring it would run the interactive form while the caller believed
they had asked for the other one.

### It never takes anything away

`update.accounts` only ever adds. A record removed from an account stays
removed. To keep an edit of your own, mark the record — see below.

## Keeping your own version of a VOC record: `[locked]`

This has no equivalent in OpenQM or in SD on Linux. Nothing you know from
another MultiValue system will tell you it exists.

A site that has customised one of SD's own VOC records marks it by putting
`[locked]` in **field 1, after the type code**. `update.accounts` then leaves
that record alone.

```
V[locked]
CA
$MYVERSION
```

### After the type code, not at the front

The first character of field 1 **is** the type, so `[locked]V` would be read as
a record of type `[`. Two characters are the type for a `P` record, and those
are the only two-character types SD uses: `PA` for a paragraph and `PH` for a
phrase.

```
PA[locked]
```

Anywhere later in field 1 works — the test searches the field rather than
matching a fixed position. Case does not matter: both sides are upper-cased
before comparison, so `[LOCKED]` and `[Locked]` are the same marker. A lock
that failed open because somebody typed it in capitals would be worse than no
lock at all, because the record it was meant to protect would be replaced
silently.

### A verb is not protected by it

**`[locked]` is honoured on every kind of VOC record except a verb.** A verb
marked `[locked]` is updated anyway, and the account is told which ones:

```
2 verb(s) marked [locked] were updated anyway: MYLIST MYREPORT
```

A verb is what SD runs. A locked one would go on naming the program, or the
internal routine number, that this release replaced — and the internal case
fails in the worst way available, because field 3 of an internal verb record is
a *number*, so a reassignment sends the verb to a different function with no
sign that anything is wrong.

**The way to get a verb that behaves differently is to add your own**, under a
name SD does not ship, modelled on the system one. `update.accounts` walks the
records SD ships, so a verb of your own is never visited and needs no marker.

### You are told what was withheld

```
3 VOC record(s) were left alone because they are marked [locked]: WINDOWS ...
```

The message names each record, and says plainly that any correction this
release made to them has not been applied here.

**That is the cost, and it belongs to the site rather than to SD.** A locked
record keeps the version the account already had, so a defect fixed in that
record stays unfixed in this account. Remove the marker from field 1 and run
`update.accounts` again to take the new version.

## Reading and setting configuration: `config`

```
config                     report every setting
config lptr                the same, to the default printer
config param value         set one
config gpl                 display the licence
config contrib             display the contributors
```

```

*(Forty-odd lines; cut here.)* **Reading needs nothing** — any account with the
verb can do it, and it is the quickest answer to *how many users, how many
locks, how many open files is this machine set up for*.

| | |
|---|---|
| *New parameter value required* | `config numlocks` with nothing after it. **The report form is `config` alone**; naming one parameter means *set it* |
| *Not a recognised private configuration parameter name* | the name is not one that can be set per-session |
| *Invalid value for this parameter* | it is, and the value is not |

**`config param value` sets a private, session-local value and not the
machine's.** The machine's settings live in SD's configuration file and are
read when SD starts. This form overrides one for the session you are in, which
is the right tool for trying a value before writing it down and the wrong one
for changing an installation.

**`config gpl` and `config contrib` read a record inside SD** rather than
running a pager over a file, so they work in any account and need no
operating-system access.

## Setting the machine's date: `set.date`

```
set.date date
```

Sets the **machine's** date, not a session preference — it changes the clock the
whole installation reads. The argument goes through SD's `D` conversion, so
anything `iconv(…, 'D')` accepts will do, and anything it does not is refused:

| | |
|---|---|
| *Date required* | `set.date` with nothing after it |
| *Invalid date format* | the argument is not a date SD can read |

**There is no confirmation and no undo.** It is described here from source
rather than shown running, because demonstrating it would move the clock of
whatever machine it ran on. **On Windows, changing the system date is itself a
privileged operation**, so a session that has the verb may
still be refused by the operating system underneath it.

**Moving a live machine's date backwards is not a neutral act**: file
timestamps, licence expiry, scheduled tasks and anything that reasons about
elapsed time all read it. Treat it as a maintenance operation on a quiet system.

## Deleting an account: `delete.account`

```
delete.account account.name
```

Removes the account directory, its Windows group, its entry in the accounts
register, and — for a user account SD itself created — the Windows account and
its profile. **One confirmation covers all of it**, and the wording is decided
before the question is asked, so it never offers to remove a Windows account it
is not going to.

**It will not delete a Windows account SD did not create.** The account is
left in place and it says so.

**Three refusals come before the confirmation**, so none of them can be reached
by accident:

| | |
|---|---|
| *Cannot delete SDSYS account* | `delete.account sdsys` |
| *Cannot delete own account* | the account you are standing in |
| *Account not registered in ACCOUNTS file* | the name is not one of SD's |

*(Those three wordings are the verb's own; they are not shown as a transcript
here because reaching them takes an elevated session, and an unelevated one is
refused by the privilege gate first — which is itself the fourth refusal, and
the one most people meet.)*

> **The confirmation is unconditional and no keyword suppresses it.** There
> is no `no.query` on this verb. **Never send `delete.account` down a pipe** —
> the prompt will eat the commands that follow it as its answers, and the
> session will then wait for ever.

## Who has these verbs

**All of them are administrator verbs.** A standard or programmer account has
none of these names at all.

| | |
|---|---|
| **needs elevation as well** | `create.account` `modify.account` `modify.password` (for another account) `delete.account` `grant` `revoke` `list.grants` |
| **the verb is enough** | `clean.account` `update.accounts` `config` |

**`list.grants` needs elevation even though it only reads.** It answers *who
may enter this account*, which is worth knowing before you have it, and the
gate is at the top of the program the three grant verbs share.
