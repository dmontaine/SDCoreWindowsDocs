Title: SD Basic - Modern Program Structure
Subtitle: Scope, local subroutines and functions, class modules and objects — writing SD BASIC the way you would write anything else.

***SD BASIC HAS SCOPE AND IT HAS OBJECTS.*** A routine can have variables of its
own that nothing else can see; a class module can hold state, expose methods and
properties, construct and destruct itself, and inherit from another class. None
of it is a bolt-on and none of it is new — it is simply not what most MultiValue
documentation talks about.

**This page is that half of the language.** [SD Basic - Program
Structure](01-sd-basic-program-structure.html) covers the traditional shape —
one program, one flat variable space, `gosub` to a label, `call` to a catalogued
subroutine — and everything here is an alternative to it, not an extension of
it.

**Everything on this page was compiled and run** on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0
before it was written down. Where a listing shows an error, that error was
produced, not composed. The programs are in the documentation repository as
`tools\probes\p18-class-base.b`, `p18-class.b` and `p18-objects.b`.

## Scope, and the one thing to get straight first

A plain `gosub` label shares every variable in the program. A **local
subroutine or function** does not have to:

```
local subroutine name {(arguments)}
   ...
   return
end

local function name {(arguments)}
   ...
   return value
end
```

***BUT A LOCAL ROUTINE IS NOT A CLOSED SCOPE, AND ASSUMING IT IS WILL CATCH
YOU.*** It can still see every variable in the main program. What it gets that a
`gosub` label does not is the ability to declare names that **do not leak back**
— its arguments, and anything it declares `private`.

Measured, in one program. A local subroutine took an argument `a` and declared
`private working`; the main program then asked what it could see:

```
ZZMATH.LOCAL.SEES.MAIN=assigned(shared.probe)=1
ZZMATH.PRIVATE.LEAKED=0
ZZMATH.ARGNAME.LEAKED=0
```

| | |
|---|---|
| a variable set in the main program | **visible** inside the local routine |
| a name the routine declared `private` | **not** visible outside it |
| the routine's own argument names | **not** visible outside it |

So the model is **shared by default, private on request.** If you want a routine
that touches nothing it was not handed, declare every working variable
`private` and take everything else as an argument. The compiler helps: naming
those variables in the main program afterwards raises *WARNING: WORKING is not
assigned a value*, because to the main program they are different names that
have never been set.

### Calling them: two different forms, and neither is `call`

***A LOCAL SUBROUTINE IS REACHED WITH `gosub`, NOT `call`.***

```
gosub tally(3, 4, answer)
```

`call` looks in the catalogue. Against a local subroutine it compiles cleanly
and then fails at run time:

```
000002B3: Unable to load 'TALLY' object code at line 62 of
/cygdrive/c/ProgramData/SD/user_accounts/don/BP.OUT/zzobj
```

***A LOCAL FUNCTION MUST BE DECLARED BEFORE IT IS USED.***

```
deffun doubled(n) local
```

Without that line the compiler has no way to know `doubled(21)` is a call, and
reads it as a subscripted array:

```
57: Data item or constant not found where expected
57: Right bracket not found where expected
89: Matrix DOUBLED is not referenced in a DIM statement
WARNING: DOUBLED is not assigned a value
```

**A local subroutine needs no such declaration** — `gosub name(…)` is
unambiguous on its own.

### The `return` is not optional

***A LOCAL ROUTINE THAT FALLS INTO ITS OWN `end` STOPS THE PROGRAM.*** The
compiler emits `end` there as a stop, not a return, so there is **no error
message and no further output** — and any object still in scope runs its
destructor on the way out, which makes it look like a clean finish.

That was measured by leaving the `return` out: the program printed everything up
to the call, nothing after it, and exited zero. **Every one of the five local
subroutines in SD's own `DEBUG` program carries an explicit `return`.**

### `deffun` does more than declare

```
deffun name(args) local                  a local function, defined below
deffun name(args) calling "!external"    an external one, under a name you choose
deffun name(args) key "F5"               bound to a function key
deffun name(args) var.args               variable argument count
```

`local` and `calling` are mutually exclusive — a function is either in this
program or somewhere else. SD's `DEBUG` uses both forms, three lines apart.

## Class modules

A class module is a program declared with `class` instead of `program`. It holds
state between calls, exposes what it chooses, and is instantiated as many times
as you like.

```
class name {inherits base {, base …}} {max.args n}

private variable, ...
public variable, ...

public subroutine create.object    ...  end
public subroutine destroy.object   ...  end
public subroutine name{(args)}     ...  end
public function name{(args)}       ...  end
get name                           ...  end
set name(value)                    ...  end

end
```

**Each member ends with its own `end`, and the module ends with one more.**
`private` and `public` declare member *variables*; `public subroutine` and
`public function` declare methods; `get` and `set` declare a property.

A class is catalogued and instantiated like any other program, and **a private
catalogue is enough** — nothing here needs an elevated session:

```
:basic bp zzcls
Compiling bp zzcls
0 error(s)
:catalog bp zzcls
ZZCLS added to private catalogue
```

## Objects

```
object(catalogued.name {, arguments})   create an instance
objinfo(variable, 0)                    1 if the variable holds an object
objinfo(variable, 1)                    the class name
variable = ''                           release it
```

```
o = object('ZZCLS')
```

```
ZZMATH.ISOBJ=1
ZZMATH.CLASS=ZZCLS
```

### `->` reaches everything

The member operator is **`->`**, and it is the same operator for all four kinds
of member. This is the part most worth having in front of you:

| you write | what it does |
|---|---|
| `o->deposit(40)` | calls a **public subroutine** |
| `o->total(10)` | calls a **public function** and yields its answer |
| `o->label` | reads a **public variable** |
| `o->label = 'Direct'` | writes one |
| `o->owner` | runs the **`get`** routine for that property |
| `o->owner = 'MIXED Case Name'` | runs the **`set`** routine for it |

All six, measured on one instance. `deposit` was called twice with 40 and 2;
`total` multiplies by its argument; the `set owner` routine lower-cases what it
is given into the public variable `label`, and `get owner` wraps it:

```
ZZMATH.TOTAL.X1=42
ZZMATH.TOTAL.X10=420
ZZMATH.LABEL.INITIAL=unnamed
ZZMATH.LABEL.AFTER=Direct
ZZMATH.OWNER=owner<mixed case name>
ZZMATH.LABEL.AFTER.SET=mixed case name
```

***A PROPERTY IS ONE NAME WITH TWO ROUTINES BEHIND IT.*** `o->owner` on the
right of an assignment runs `get owner`; on the left it runs `set owner(value)`.
To the caller it reads exactly like a variable, which is the point — the class
can validate, transform or compute without the caller knowing.

### Private members do not exist from outside

```
:crt p->balance
000003C1: Unrecognised property/method name (BALANCE). at line 92
```

**Note the wording.** It is not *"private"* — from outside the class the name is
not a member at all. `private` is genuine encapsulation, not a convention.

The way to expose one is to write a public routine that returns it, which is
what `reveal()` does in the measured class.

## Construction and destruction

`create.object` and `destroy.object` are hooks, not calls you make. **They run
by themselves**, and this is where an object earns its keep over a set of
subroutines and a common block:

```
ZZBASE.CREATE.OBJECT
ZZCLS.CREATE.OBJECT balance=0
...
ZZMATH.BEFORE.UNLOAD
ZZCLS.DESTROY.OBJECT balance=42
ZZBASE.DESTROY.OBJECT
ZZMATH.AFTER.UNLOAD
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **construction runs base first** | `ZZBASE` then `ZZCLS` |
| **destruction runs in reverse** | `ZZCLS` then `ZZBASE` |
| **releasing the variable is what fires it** | `o = ''`, and the two destructors ran between the lines either side of it |

***THAT IS THE ONE THING A COMMON BLOCK CANNOT GIVE YOU.*** A file left open, a
lock held, a socket connected — a destructor closes it when the last reference
goes, whatever route the program took to get there. SD's own client library uses
exactly this: `destroy.object` in `SDCLIENT` disconnects the session if one is
still up.

## Inheritance

```
class derived inherits base
```

The base class's public members become the derived class's, and the derived
class may override them. Measured on a class inheriting `ZZBASE`:

```
ZZMATH.WHOAMI=ZZCLS
ZZMATH.TAG=base-tag
ZZMATH.REVEAL=base-private
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `whoami()` | **the derived version won** — both classes define it |
| `tag` | a public **variable** of the base, reached through the derived object |
| `reveal()` | a base public function returning the base's own `private` member |

The last row is the interesting one: **a base class's private state stays
private, and reaches the outside only through whatever the base chooses to
expose.** Inheritance does not flatten encapsulation.

### The runtime form

```
inherit object
disinherit object
```

These are statements, used **inside a class**, that add or remove another
*instance's* members at run time rather than at compile time. Using either
outside a class module is an error — *DISINHERIT not in class*. The `inherits`
clause is the one to reach for first; the statements exist for the case where
what you inherit is decided while running.

## `objinfo` and releasing

```
objinfo(v, 0)     1 if v holds an object, 0 otherwise — safe on any variable
objinfo(v, 1)     the class name; an error if v is not an object
unload.object name
```

**Key 0 is the safe one.** It is the only key that does not require the variable
to be an object already, so it is what you test with before anything else.

## Where SD itself does this

***THE CLAIM THAT NOTHING USES THIS IS WRONG, AND IT IS WORTH KNOWING WHAT
DOES.***

| | |
|---|---|
| `gpl.bp/SDCLIENT` | **SD's own client library is a class module** — 1,040 lines, 33 members, `create.object` and `destroy.object` both defined. Connecting to another SD server from BASIC means instantiating it |
| `gpl.bp/DEBUG` | five `local subroutine`s and a `local function`, with `deffun … local` above them |

## Choosing between the two shapes

| reach for | when |
|---|---|
| **`gosub` label** | a few lines, used once, sharing the program's variables on purpose |
| **local subroutine or function** | anything with working variables of its own, or that you want to be sure touches nothing else |
| **catalogued subroutine** | logic more than one program needs |
| **class module** | state that has a lifetime — something opened, held and closed — or several instances of the same thing at once |
