Title: SD TCL - Alternate Key Indexes
Subtitle: Indexing a field so records can be found by its contents, and the step that is easy to skip.

An alternate key index lets SD find records by what is in a field instead of by
record id. Five verbs make, populate, inspect and remove them.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> `K`.

## Use `make.index`

**That is the whole of this page's advice.** `create.index` and `build.index`
are two halves of what `make.index` does in one command, and **the half that is
easy to miss is the second one**:

```
make.index zzak f2
```

```
Added index for F2
Building index 'F2'...
6 records processed
Populating index...
```

Use the two-step form only when you have a reason to separate them.

## The five verbs

| | |
|---|---|
| **`create.index`** *file* *field*… | define an index. **Does not populate it** |
| **`build.index`** *file* *field*… \| **all** | populate it from the records already there |
| **`make.index`** *file* *field*… | both, in one command |
| **`list.index`** *file* *field*… | what indexes the file has, and whether they work |
| **`delete.index`** *file* *field*… \| **all** | remove them |

`create.index` and `make.index` also take:

| | |
|---|---|
| **`no.nulls`** | do not index records whose field is empty |
| **`pathname`** *path* | put the index somewhere other than beside the file |

## Why the two-step form catches people

`create.index` records the definition and **walks nothing**:

```
create.index zzak f1
```

```
Added index for F1
```

That reports success, and the index it made matches no records at all. The
proof is in `list.index`:

```
list.index zzak f1
```

```
Alternate key indices for file zzak
Number of indices = 1
Index name...... En Type Nulls S/M Fmt Field/Expression
F1                N  D    Yes   S   L  1
```

**The `En` column is the one to read. `N` means the index is not enabled** —
it exists, it is listed, and it will not find anything. After `build.index` the
same line reads `Y`:

```
F1                Y  D    Yes   S   L  1
```

**So `list.index` is the check**, and *"the index is there"* is not the same
question as *"the index works"*.

## `build.index` needs the file to itself

```
build.index zzak f1
```

```
Cannot gain exclusive access to file
```

**That is what you get If anything has the file open — including the command
you just typed.** Measured: `create.index` followed by `build.index` **in the
same session** fails this way every time, because `create.index` left the file
open. From a fresh session it succeeds:

```
Building index 'F1'...
6 records processed
Populating index...
```

**`make.index` does not have this problem**, which is the practical reason to
prefer it.

> **A session that was killed rather than logged out also holds the file.**
> Its entry stays in the user table, `listu` still lists it, and `build.index`
> is refused with the message above until it is cleared. If a build is refused
> and you are certain nothing is using the file, run `listu` before looking for
> anything more exotic.

## Asking what a file has

```
list.index zzak f1 f2
```

```
Alternate key indices for file zzak
Number of indices = 2
Index name...... En Type Nulls S/M Fmt Field/Expression
F1                Y  D    Yes   S   L  1
F2                Y  D    Yes   S   L  2
```

| column | |
|---|---|
| `En` | enabled — **`Y` only after a successful build** |
| `Type` | `D` for a field, `I` for a computed expression |
| `Nulls` | whether empty values are indexed — `no.nulls` at creation is what changes it |
| `S/M` | single- or multi-valued |
| `Fmt` | the key's format code, as a dictionary entry carries it |
| `Field/Expression` | the field number, or the I-type expression |

A file with none says so plainly:

```
File has no indices
```

## Using an index

**Nothing changes in how you write a query.** An index makes a selection on that
field faster; it does not add syntax and it does not change the answer:

```
count zzak with f1 = "V"
```

```
5 record(s) counted
```

That is the same command, and the same result, as before the index existed.
**Index the fields you actually select on** — each index makes every write to
the file a little more expensive, and one that is never used in a `with` clause
costs and returns nothing.

Once built, an index maintains itself: ordinary writes and deletes keep it
current with no further action. Reading an index from a program — `selectindex`,
`indices()` — is in
[SD Basic - Alternate Key Indexes](09-sd-basic-alternate-key-indexes.html),
which also has the measured detail on why **an already-open file variable never
learns about a new index**.

## Removing an index

```
delete.index zzak all
```

```
Deleted index F1
Deleted index F2
```

`all` removes every index on the file. Naming them individually also works —
with one catch:

> **`delete.index` matches the index name exactly, and index names are held in
> upper case.** `delete.index zzak f1` answers *"Unrecognised index name
> (f1)"* — on a file where `list.index zzak f1` had just found the index and
> printed it. **`list.index` folds case and `delete.index` does not**, so a name
> that lists perfectly well may still refuse to delete. Use **`all`**, or type
> the name exactly as `list.index` prints it.

Deleting the file removes its indexes with it.

## Who has these verbs

**All five are programmer verbs.** A standard account has none of them, and does
not need them — an index changes how a query runs, not how it is written, so a
standard account gets the benefit of every index without being able to create
or destroy one.
