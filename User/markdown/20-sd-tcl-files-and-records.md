Title: SD TCL - Files and Records
Subtitle: Making, configuring and removing files; copying, renaming, deleting and dumping the records inside them.

This page covers the verbs that act on a whole file or on the records in it,
from the command line. What a program does with the same files is
[SD Basic - File Handling](07-sd-basic-file-handling.html); this is the part you
type.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case, which is what this port uses on disk. In the tables, *italics*
mark something you supply and **bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces
mark an optional part.

## The two kinds of file, and what they look like in Explorer

**Both kinds are a directory on Windows.** This surprises people who expect a
database file to be one file.

| | |
|---|---|
| **dynamic** | a directory holding components named `%0`, `%1`, … The records are hashed across them and none of it is readable from outside SD |
| **directory** | a directory holding **one ordinary file per record**, named by the record id |

`voc`, `$ipc` and `dict.dic` are dynamic. `messages`, `accounts` and `bp` are
directory files — which is why you can open a BASIC program in Notepad and why
`gpl.bp` is readable in the source tree.

**A dictionary is a separate file that travels with the data file.** Verbs that
can act on either take `dict` in front of the file name; with no `dict` they
mean the data portion.

**The shipped file names are lower case on disk in this port.** `voc`, `bp`,
`newvoc`, `accounts`, `messages` and the rest were renamed. NTFS matches without
being asked, so this changes nothing about what you can type — but it is what
you will see in Explorer and in the path text SD reports back.

## Making and removing files

```
create.file {dict|data} voc.name directory
create.file {dict|data} voc.name dynamic {parameters}
create.file voc.name using dict filename
```

`create.file` makes the file **and** the VOC record that names it. Without
`dict` or `data` it makes both portions. `using dict` *filename* takes the
dictionary from an existing file instead of creating an empty one, and
`no.query` suppresses the confirmation.

Dynamic files take parameters, all optional:

| | |
|---|---|
| `minimum.modulus` *n* | the floor the file will not shrink below |
| `group.size` *n* | group size in 1 KB units |
| `large.record` *n* | the size above which a record is stored separately |
| `split.load` *n* · `merge.load` *n* | the load factors that trigger growth and shrink |
| `version` *n* | file format version |
| `directory` *path* | put the file at *path* instead of in the account |
| `no.case` | record ids are case-insensitive |
| `no.resize` | disable automatic resizing |

```
delete.file {dict|data} voc.name {force} {no.query}
clear.file {dict|data} file
```

`delete.file` removes the file and its VOC record. **`force` is needed if the
file is not empty.** `clear.file` empties a file and keeps it, along with its
dictionary and its indexes.

## Changing a file after it exists

```
configure.file {dict} voc.name {parameters}
configure.file {dict} voc.name default
```

The parameters are the `create.file` ones, plus `immediate` to do the work now
rather than lazily, and `dynamic` or `directory` to change the file's kind.
`default` puts the settings back.

**Two of them restructure the whole file.** Changing `group.size` or `version`
requires a full restructure; the rest take effect without one. Plan for the time
and the disk on a large file.

`no.case` / `case` and `resize` / `no.resize` are the pairs that turn a setting
on and off. For a directory file, `binary` turns on mark mapping.

## Looking at a file

```
analyse.file {dict} file {statistics} {lptr}
```

Without `statistics` it reports the shape: the account, the file name, the path,
the type, the group size, the large-record size, the minimum and current
modulus, the load factors and the size in bytes. With `statistics` it walks the
whole file and adds record counts, per-group minimum, maximum and average, and a
size distribution. **`statistics` reads every group**, so it is not free on a big
file.

`analyze.file` is the same verb under the other spelling.

```
fstat filename on            start collecting, clearing the counters
fstat filename {lptr}        show what has been collected
fstat filename off           stop collecting
fstat global {lptr}          the global counters
fstat reset                  clear the global counters
fstat                        the periodic global summary
```

**`fstat` only works on dynamic files.** A directory file named on the command
line gets a warning; one arriving through a select list is skipped silently.
Where a file name is taken, a select list or several names may be given instead.

```
hsm {on|off|display} {user n}
```

The Hot Spot Monitor. `display` is the default.

```
list.files
```

Reports how many files are open now, the peak for the session and the
configured limit, then lists them:

```
Number of files open = 2.  Peak = 6.  Limit = 80.
```

The limit is the `NUMFILES` configuration parameter. **The peak is what matters
when you are sizing it** — the current figure moves constantly and tells you
almost nothing.

## Reaching a file in another account

```
set.file account file.name pointer.name
```

This writes a **Q-pointer** into your VOC — an indirect pointer naming another
account and a file in it. After it, *pointer.name* is usable wherever a file name
is, and the data stays where it is.

**The account must be in the accounts register**, and the name is folded to
upper case before the register is read. If it is not there you get *Account name
'…' is not in register* and nothing is written.

> **Read what `set.file` prints, not just whether it printed.** Its refusals
> echo the names you passed in, so a script that checks its output for the
> pointer name it asked for will find that name in the refusal as well as in the
> success. Check for the success wording, and treat *not in register* and *not
> found* as disqualifiers.

## Copying, deleting and renaming records

```
copy from {dict} src.file {to {dict} tgt.file} {s1{,t1} {s2{,t2}}...}
copy from {dict} src.file {to {dict} tgt.file} all
```

With no `to` clause the copy is **within the source file**, which is how you
duplicate a record under a new id. Each *s*`,`*t* pair is a source id and the id
to give the copy; a bare *s* keeps the id. Options:

| | |
|---|---|
| `overwriting` | replace records that already exist in the target |
| `updating` | copy **only** records that already exist in the target |
| `deleting` | delete the source record after a successful copy |
| `reporting` | list what was copied |
| `binary` | force binary mode when one side is hashed and the other a directory |

`@system.return.code` comes back as the **number of records copied**, or
negative on error.

```
copyp {dict} filename id... {(options}
```

The Pick-style copy. Its options are single letters in a trailing bracket:
`d` delete source, `i` suppress the id, `n` no pagination, `o` overwrite,
`p` to the printer, `s` suppress field numbers, `t` to the terminal.

```
delete {dict} file.name {record.name} {no.query}
delete {dict} file.name all
```

`@system.return.code` is the **number of records deleted**, or negative on error.

```
cname old.file.name to new.file.name
cname {dict} file.name old.record.name to new.record.name
```

A comma may be used instead of `to`. `rename` is the same verb under the other
name. `@system.return.code` is `0` on success and `-1` if the arguments were
wrong.

**`cname` on a file renames the VOC record too**, which is the point — the
name you type and the name on disk stay together.

## Seeing what is actually in a record

```
ct {dict} file.name {record.name... | *} {options}
dump {dict} file.name {record.name... | *} {options}
```

Both are the same program. `ct` is a field-by-field listing; `dump` reports the
same data in binary. Options: `hex` for hexadecimal, `binary` for a full-width
report that is not field-based, `no.query` to skip the prompt when a select list
is in use, and `lptr` {*n*} to send it to a print unit.

**`ct` is the one verb here a standard account has**; `dump` is withheld. They
run the same code, and the line between the tiers runs between the two VOC
records rather than through the program.

## Triggers

```
set.trigger file.name trigger.name {modes}
set.trigger file.name ""
set.trigger file.name
```

Set, remove, or display a file's trigger function. An empty string in quotes
removes it; no argument at all displays it.

## Who has these verbs

**Almost everything on this page is withheld from a standard account.** That is
deliberate: these are the verbs that change data in bulk.

| | |
|---|---|
| **standard** | `ct` `list.files` `set.file` |
| **programmer** | `analyse.file` `analyze.file` `clear.file` `cname` `configure.file` `copy` `copyp` `create.file` `delete` `delete.file` `dump` `fstat` `hsm` `rename` `set.trigger` |

A standard account can therefore look at a record and point at a file, and
cannot create, empty, delete, copy or rename anything. An account that does not
have a verb does not have the VOC record for it, so the name is not recognised
at all rather than refused.

## What is not here

**Indexes are their own subject** and are not on this page. For what an index
is and what it does to a file, see [SD Basic - Alternate Key
Indexes](09-sd-basic-alternate-key-indexes.html).

**Selecting records is the query processor's job**, not these verbs'. `copy`,
`delete` and `ct` all accept a select list built by `select` or `sselect`, and
that is how they are usually driven over more than a handful of ids.

**`reformat` and `sreformat`** rewrite records through a dictionary and are run
by the query processor, so they are documented with it.

**There is no verb that repairs a damaged file.** `analyse.file statistics` will
tell you a file is badly overflowed; `configure.file` is what acts on that.
