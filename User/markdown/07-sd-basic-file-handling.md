Title: SD Basic - File Handling
Subtitle: Opening files, reading and writing records, locking, and transactions.

This page covers the statements that reach the database: opening a file,
reading and writing whole records or single fields, the locking that keeps two
sessions out of each other's way, and transactions.

Sequential files — ordinary operating-system files read a line at a time — are
in *SD Basic - Sequential Files*. Select lists are in
[SD Basic - Select Lists](08-sd-basic-select-lists.html).

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every result on this page was measured, not quoted.** The values shown were
> produced by a program that created a file, wrote to it, read it back and
> deleted it, compiled and run on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## Opening

```
open {dict,} file.name to file.variable {readonly}
   then statements
else statements

openpath pathname to file.variable {readonly}
   then statements
else statements
```

`open` looks the name up in the account's VOC. `openpath` takes an operating
system path and bypasses the VOC entirely.

***THE `else` BRANCH IS WHERE A MISSING FILE ARRIVES, AND IT IS NOT
OPTIONAL.*** A program that omits it does not compile. Never leave it empty:

```
open 'CUSTOMERS' to f.cust else
   stop 'Cannot open CUSTOMERS'
end
```

**`dict` opens the dictionary rather than the data portion** —
`open 'dict', 'CUSTOMERS' to f.dict else ...`.

`close file.variable` releases it. A file left open is closed when the program
ends, so `close` matters mainly in a long-running program that opens files in a
loop.

## Reading

```
read variable from file.variable, record.id then ... else ...
readv variable from file.variable, record.id, field then ... else ...
matread matrix from file.variable, record.id then ... else ...
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `read` | the whole record into one dynamic array |
| `readv` | a single field |
| `matread` | the record spread across a dimensioned matrix, one field per element |

Measured on a record holding `alpha` and `beta|gamma`:

| | Result |
|---|---|
| `read got from f, 'R1'` | `then` branch; `dcount(got, @fm)` is `2` |
| `read got from f, 'NOSUCH'` | **`else` branch** |
| `readv fv from f, 'R1', 2` | `beta\|gamma` |

***A MISSING RECORD IS THE `else` BRANCH, NOT AN ERROR.*** And `status()` after
one reads **3006**, which is how you tell "no such record" from a real failure
such as a permission problem.

***`matread` PUTS EVERYTHING PAST THE END OF THE MATRIX INTO ELEMENT ZERO.***
Measured: a three-field record read into `dim mm(2)` gives `mm(1)` = `f1`,
`mm(2)` = `f2` and **`mm(0)` = `f3`**. Nothing is lost and nothing is reported.

**`inmat()` does not tell you it happened** — measured, it read `0` after that
`matread`, not `3`. It reports the element count after `matparse`, not after
`matread`. If a record may have more fields than your matrix, `read` it and use
`dcount(rec, @fm)`, or size the matrix from the dictionary.

## Writing

```
write variable to file.variable, record.id
writev variable to file.variable, record.id, field
matwrite matrix to file.variable, record.id
```

Writing creates the record if it does not exist and replaces it if it does.
There is no "insert only" form — read first if that distinction matters, and
hold a lock between the read and the write or two sessions will both find it
absent.

`delete file.variable, record.id` removes a record. Measured: after
`delete f, 'R2'`, reading `R2` takes the `else` branch.

`clearfile file.variable` empties the file but leaves it in place.

## Locking

SD locks a **record**, not a row or a page, and the lock belongs to the session.

```
readu variable from file.variable, record.id {locked ...} then ... else ...
readvu variable from file.variable, record.id, field ...
matreadu matrix from file.variable, record.id ...
recordlocku file.variable, record.id
recordlockl file.variable, record.id
release {file.variable {, record.id}}
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `readu` | read **and take an update lock** |
| `readl` | read and take a shared read lock |
| `recordlocku` | take an update lock without reading |
| `release` | give locks back |

`write` releases the lock it finds. `release` with no arguments releases
everything the session holds.

```
recordlocked(file.variable, record.id)
```

reports the state. Measured: after `readu`, `recordlocked(f, 'R1')` is **2**;
an unlocked record reads **0**; after `release f, 'R1'` it is **0** again.

***THE `locked` CLAUSE IS THE ONLY WAY NOT TO WAIT.*** Without it, a `readu`
against a record another session holds **blocks until that session lets go**.
With it, control goes to the `locked` branch immediately:

```
readu rec from f, id locked
   print 'Someone else is editing that record.'
   return
end then
   ...
end else
   ...
end
```

A program without a `locked` clause is a program that can hang a user
indefinitely with no message. **Any interactive read-for-update should have
one.**

`filelock` and `fileunlock` lock a whole file, and `lock` / `unlock` take one
of 64 numbered general-purpose semaphores — used to serialise something that is
not a record at all, such as a report run.

## Transactions

```
begin transaction
   ...
   commit
   ...
   rollback
end transaction
```

Everything written between `begin transaction` and `commit` either all lands or
none of it does. `rollback` discards the lot.

**Locks taken inside a transaction are held until it ends**, whichever way it
ends. That is what makes the transaction safe and also what makes a long one
expensive — keep the span short, and never wait for user input inside one.

## Asking about a file

```
fileinfo(file.variable, key)
```

Measured on a newly created dynamic file:

| Key | Meaning | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | is this variable an open file? | `1` |
| `1` | the VOC name it was opened by | `ZZWORK` |
| `2` | the path on disk | `/cygdrive/c/ProgramData/SD/user_accounts/don/ZZWORK` |
| `3` | file type | `3` |
| `5` | modulus | |
| `6` | minimum modulus | `1` |
| `7` | group size | |
| `11` | current load percentage | |
| `13` | does the file have alternate key indexes? | |
| `1001` | read-only? | |
| `1003` | size in bytes, excluding indexes | |

File types: `1` SH, **`3` DH — an ordinary dynamic file**, `4` directory, `5`
sequential.

> ***THE PATH COMES BACK IN POSIX FORM, NOT AS A WINDOWS PATH.*** Measured:
> `/cygdrive/c/ProgramData/...`, not `C:\ProgramData\...`. **Handing that
> string to a Windows program does not work** — Windows reads it as a
> drive-relative path and either fails silently or reports that the parent
> directory does not exist. Convert it first with `kernel(K$WINPATH, path)`,
> and refuse an empty answer rather than passing it on. This is not a
> theoretical caution: it is what stopped the full-screen editors working the
> first time they were built for this port.

> **There is no record-count key.** Key `6` is the *minimum modulus* and reads
> `1` on a small file whatever it contains — measured `1` with two records
> present and `1` again after `clearfile`. To count records, `select` the file
> and read `selectinfo(list, 3)`, or count in a `readnext` loop.

`dir(pathname)` lists an operating-system directory as a dynamic array — name,
size and modification time per entry.

## Reaching another file's data

```
trans({dict} file.name, record.id, field, action)
rtrans({dict} file.name, record.id, field, action)
xlate({dict} file.name, record.id, field, action)
```

All three fetch one field of one record from a named file, opening it if
needed. `trans` and `xlate` are the same function under two names; `rtrans`
takes an already-open file variable instead of a name.

The *action* says what to do when the record is missing:

| | |
|---|---|
| **x** | return the null string |
| **v** | return the null string and print an error |
| **c** | return the record id itself |
| **n** | return the record id itself |

A *field* of `0` returns the record id.

**These open a file on every call unless it is already open.** In a loop over
many records that is a real cost — `open` the file once and use `rtrans`, or
read it directly.

## Creating and configuring

```
create.file path {directory | dynamic}
create file.variable then ... else ...
configure.file file.variable, key, value
```

Most applications create files with the `create.file` **command** rather than
the statement — from BASIC, `execute 'create.file ...'` is the usual route, and
it is what the measured examples on this page used.

`set.trigger` attaches a program that runs on every write or delete to a file.
A trigger runs inside the caller's transaction, so anything it does is part of
the same all-or-nothing unit.

## What is not here

Nothing in the file-handling group has been removed from this port, but two
things about it changed:

| | |
|---|---|
| **VFS** | the virtual file system layer has been **removed from the C entirely**. `fileinfo()` never reports a VFS type, and the type code is gone |
| **The data tree is private** | `C:\ProgramData\SD` is protected by an access-control list. A file created by SD is reachable through SD, and not by an ordinary Windows user poking at the directory |
