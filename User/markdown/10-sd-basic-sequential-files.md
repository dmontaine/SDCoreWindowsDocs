Title: SD Basic - Sequential Files
Subtitle: Reading and writing ordinary operating-system files a line or a block at a time.

A sequential file is an ordinary file on disk, read and written a line at a
time rather than a record at a time. It is how SD exchanges data with anything
that is not SD — a log, an export, a file dropped in a folder by another
system.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

## Opening

```
openseq file.name, record.id {append | overwrite | readonly} to file.variable
   then statements
else statements

openseq pathname {append | overwrite | readonly} to file.variable
   then ... else ...
```

The two-name form addresses a record inside a **directory** file — an SD file
whose records are ordinary files in a folder. The one-name form takes an
operating system path and reaches anything on the machine the account is
allowed to read.

***THE `then` AND `else` BRANCHES DO NOT MEAN SUCCESS AND FAILURE.***

| | |
|---|---|
| `then` | the file **already existed** |
| `else` | it did **not** exist, and has been created — **or** the open genuinely failed |

Measured: `openseq 'ZZDIR', 'LINES'` on a name that did not exist took the
`else` branch and gave a usable file variable.

**So `else` is not an error branch**, and a program that writes `stop 'cannot
open'` there will refuse to create a file it was supposed to create. To tell
"created" from "failed", test the variable — a failed open leaves it unusable
and the next `writeseq` takes *its* `else` branch.

| keyword | |
|---|---|
| **append** | position at the end, so writes add to what is there |
| **overwrite** | truncate on open |
| **readonly** | open without taking a write lock |

## Reading

```
readseq variable from file.variable {on error statements} then ... else ...
readblk variable from file.variable, bytes then ... else ...
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `readseq` | one line, **without** its terminator |
| `readblk` | a fixed number of bytes, terminators included |

`readseq`'s `else` branch is end of file. Measured: three lines written and
read back gave `3` and the first as `line one`, and `status()` at end of file
read **3006** — the same code a missing record gives in
[SD Basic - File Handling](07-sd-basic-file-handling.html).

```
openseq 'EXPORT', 'DATA' to f else stop 'cannot open'
loop
   readseq line from f else exit
   ...
repeat
closeseq f
```

## Writing

```
writeseq variable to file.variable then ... else ...
writeseqf variable to file.variable then ... else ...
writeblk variable to file.variable
weofseq file.variable
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `writeseq` | write a line and a terminator |
| `writeseqf` | the same, then **flush** to disk |
| `writeblk` | write bytes with no terminator added |
| `weofseq` | truncate the file at the current position |

***`writeseq` DOES NOT FLUSH.*** A program that writes a log and then aborts
can lose the tail. `writeseqf` costs a disk write per line, which is why it is
a separate statement — use it for anything that has to survive a crash, and
`writeseq` plus a `flush` at the end for bulk output.

`weofseq` at the start of a file is how you empty it: `openseq` positions at
the beginning, and truncating there discards everything.

### The line terminator is CRLF

***MEASURED, BYTE BY BYTE.*** Two lines written with `writeseq` and read back
with `readblk`:

| | |
|---|---|
| bytes | `65 66 13 10 67 68 13 10` |
| meaning | `A` `B` **CR LF** `C` `D` **CR LF** |

**This port writes CRLF, not LF.** That is deliberate — a file SD produces
opens correctly in Notepad and every other Windows tool, which was not true of
the Linux original. `readseq` accepts either, and strips whichever it finds,
so a file written on Linux still reads correctly here.

**It matters when you count bytes.** A file of *n* lines is *n* bytes longer
than the same file with LF endings, so an offset computed by adding up line
lengths must allow two bytes per line, not one.

## Position

```
seek file.variable {, offset {, relative.to}}
```

| *relative.to* | |
|---|---|
| `0` | from the start of the file |
| `1` | from the current position |
| `2` | from the end |

Measured: `seek sq, 0, 0` followed by `readseq` returned the first line;
`seek sq, 5, 0` followed by `readblk sq, 4` returned the four bytes from
offset 5.

`seek` with no offset returns to the start. Mixing `seek` with `readseq` is
safe, but an offset that lands in the middle of a CRLF gives a `readseq` that
starts with a stray terminator.

## Buffering and timeouts

```
nobuf file.variable
flush file.variable
timeout file.variable, seconds
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `nobuf` | turn buffering off for this file — every write goes straight out |
| `flush` | push what is buffered now |
| `timeout` | how long a read waits before giving up |

`nobuf` is for a file another process is watching. `timeout` matters on a
named pipe or a device, where a read can otherwise block for ever; on an
ordinary file it does nothing useful.

## Asking about the file

```
status variable from file.variable then ... else ...
```

Fills *variable* with the operating system's view of the file. Measured: **21
fields** — size, timestamps, permissions and the rest, in the order the C
library reports them.

`fileinfo(file.variable, 5)` reports a sequential file's type as **5**, and
key `1006` gives the current position.

## Deleting

```
deleteseq file.name, record.id then ... else ...
deleteseq pathname then ... else ...
```

Removes the file. `closeseq` releases the variable without deleting anything;
a sequential file left open is closed when the program ends, but the buffered
tail is only guaranteed once `closeseq` has run.

## Directory files, and where the marks go

A **directory** file is an SD file whose records are ordinary files. That is
what makes sequential access to them possible, and it is the usual target for
`openseq`.

Because the records are ordinary files, SD has to decide what to do with mark
characters on the way in and out. `mark.mapping` controls it — see
[SD Basic - Dynamic Arrays](05-sd-basic-dynamic-arrays.html). With mapping on,
field marks become newlines and back again; with it off the bytes pass through
untouched, which is what you want for a file another system produced.

## What is not here

Nothing in the sequential-file group has been removed from this port. The
**VFS** layer, which used to sit between these statements and the operating
system, has been removed from the C entirely.
