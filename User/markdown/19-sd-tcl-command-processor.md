Title: SD TCL - The Command Processor
Subtitle: How a command line is read, what the VOC does with it, and how sentences and paragraphs run.

TCL is the prompt you get when you start SD. It is not a shell: it does not
search a path, it does not expand wildcards, and it has no built-in commands of
its own. **Every command you type is a record in a file**, and this page is
mostly about that file and about the small set of verbs that control the
session you are typing into.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown
here in lower case, which is what this port uses on disk. In the tables,
*italics* mark something you supply and **bold** marks a word typed as it
stands; braces mark an optional part.

## The prompt

The command processor is a BASIC program, `$CPROC`, and it runs a loop: show
any waiting messages, print the prompt, read a line, dispatch it, repeat. The
prompt character is `?` and it is what `system(26)` reports.

**Messages sent by `message` are printed at the prompt, not when they arrive.**
They queue in the `$ipc` file and the loop drains that queue immediately before
each prompt, so a message sent to a session sitting at TCL appears at once and
a message sent to a session running a long report appears when the report
finishes.

`report.src` turns on a line after every command reading `SRC = ` and the value
of `@system.return.code`. It takes `on`, `off`, or nothing at all, in which case
it toggles.

## Where a command goes

The first word of the line is looked up in the account's `voc` file. **What
comes back decides everything else**, because field 1 of a VOC record begins
with a type character:

| | |
|---|---|
| `V` | a verb — the common case |
| `K` | a query-processor keyword, which may also be a verb (see below) |
| `S` | a sentence: one stored command line |
| `PA` | a paragraph: several stored command lines, with flow control |
| `M` | a menu |
| `Q` | an indirect pointer to a file in another account |
| `F` | a file |
| `R` | a pointer to a record in another file, re-read and re-parsed |
| `X` | miscellaneous data — not a command |
| `D` | a data descriptor, which is what dictionary records are |

The rest of field 1 is free text and is ignored, so a verb record whose field 1
reads `Verb to compile SD BASIC program` is type `V` and the sentence is a
comment. **This is worth knowing before you edit a VOC record by hand**: the
first character is load-bearing and the remaining thirty are not.

### Names are tried as typed, then lower, then upper

This port shipped a change here. Where SD used to try the name exactly as typed
and then in upper case, it now tries **as typed, then lower case, then upper
case**. That is what lets a lower-case `voc`, `bp` and `newvoc` on disk coexist
with code and habits that still type names in upper case, and it is why you can
type `list voc` or `LIST VOC` and reach the same file.

**Account names are the deliberate exception.** They are still folded upward,
and that is what makes signing in case-insensitive.

### A hyphen is accepted where the verb has a dot

After the three case attempts, the command processor tries the name again with
any hyphens changed to dots. **So every dotted verb also answers to a hyphen.**

```
:clear-select
Cleared numbered select list 0
:clear.select
Cleared numbered select list 0
```

This is a spelling variant rather than a second verb, and two controls show it:

```
:zzz-nosuch
zzz-nosuch is not in your VOC
:ct voc create-account
Record 'create-account' not found
```

The first shows the fallback is not accepting anything at all. The second shows
there is no `create-account` record in the VOC — the resolution happens in the
command processor, not in the file.

**The dotted spelling is the documented one** and is what every page here uses.
The hyphen form is supported, and it is worth knowing because a typed hyphen
will not produce the error you expect.

### If the VOC has nothing, the catalogue is tried

A name that is not in the VOC is looked for in the **private catalogue** of the
account and then in the **global catalogue**, `gcat`. A hit is treated exactly
as though the VOC had held `V` / `CA` / *name*. This is why a program you have
catalogued can be run by typing its name with no VOC record of its own.

If neither has it, the command is refused by name.

### A keyword can be a verb

Four records that ship are a keyword **and** a verb in one record: `break`,
`count`, `display` and `off`. Their field 2 is the keyword number the query
processor uses, and **fields 3 onward are a complete verb record**, which the
command processor re-parses when the name is typed as a command.

**This matters for counting what an account has.** A tally of VOC records
whose field 1 begins with `V` misses all four, and `count` is not a marginal
verb. A standard account has **82** verbs, not 78.

## What kind of thing a verb is

Field 2 of a verb record says how to run it, and field 3 says what to run:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `CA` | *name* | a catalogued program — 97 of the shipped verbs |
| `IN` | *n* | internal verb *n*, handled by the command processor itself — 45 |
| `OS` | *text* | an operating-system command — `sh` and `!` |
| `CS` | *path* | a locally catalogued function |

Field 4 carries dispatch options and **field 5 names a security subroutine**. If
field 5 is present, that subroutine is called before the verb runs and can
refuse it, in which case you are told the command is restricted. None of the
shipped verbs uses field 5 — **the tiering in this port is done by giving or
withholding the VOC record**, not by a security subroutine — but the mechanism
is there for a site that wants a verb guarded rather than absent.

There are **41 internal verbs**, numbered, and the numbers are positional in the
command processor's dispatch list. Several names share one: `off` and `quit` are
both internal verb 1, `clr` and `cs` are both 2, and each of `clear.data`,
`clear.input`, `clear.prompts` and `clear.select` has a run-together spelling
(`cleardata` and the rest) pointing at the same number.

## Sentences and paragraphs

A **sentence** is a VOC record holding one command line. Typing its name runs
that line with anything else you typed appended, so a sentence is a command with
its first arguments filled in.

A **paragraph** holds several lines and is the closest thing SD Core has to a
shell script. Six verbs exist for paragraphs and **four of them are refused
outside one**:

| | |
|---|---|
| **`if`** *value* *op* *value* **;** *command* | conditional. Only inside a paragraph |
| **`go`** *label* | jump to a label. Only inside a paragraph |
| **`stop`** | end this paragraph, return to the caller |
| **`abort`** {*text*} | end the paragraph **and everything that called it** |
| **`display`** *text* | write a line to the terminal |
| **`pause`** | print a *press return* prompt and wait |

`go` searches forward from the current line for a line beginning with the
label; **a label prefixed with `@` is searched for from line 1 instead**, which
is how you jump backwards. Labels carry a trailing colon, and one is added for
you if you leave it off.

`display` understands a leading cursor-position clause, so
`display @(0,0) ready` positions and then writes. A trailing colon suppresses
the newline.

**`data` lines are read ahead of the verb, not executed in sequence.** Before a
verb runs, the command processor scans forward over any immediately following
`data`, comment and blank lines and stacks their text as typed-ahead input. So
the `data` lines that feed a program are written *after* the command that runs
it, and they must follow it without an intervening ordinary command.

Paragraphs nest, and `abort` unwinds all of them.
