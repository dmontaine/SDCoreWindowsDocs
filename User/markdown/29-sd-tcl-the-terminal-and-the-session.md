Title: SD TCL - The Terminal and the Session
Subtitle: Screen size, terminal behaviour, silence, the inactivity timer, and writing to the error log.

Two different things are called the terminal. **`term` is the page** — how wide
and how deep SD thinks your screen is, which decides where output wraps and when
it pauses. **`pterm` is the wire** — how bytes are treated on the way in and out.
They are set separately and are almost never confused once you have seen both.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
something you type as it stands.

## The page: `term`

```
term                             display the settings
term {width} {, lines} {type}    set them
term colour {bgc}{,fgc}          set display colour
term default                     back to the defaults
term display                     show the terminfo bindings
```

```
:term
Page width: 200
Page depth: 9999
Device    : windows
```

**Depth is what decides paging.** A listing longer than the page pauses; set the
depth very large and it does not. That is why scripts driving SD open with
something like `term 200,9999` — a script has nobody to press a key at a
`Press any key` prompt, and a paged listing down a pipe stops for ever.

**Width sets only the width**, and the two are independent:

```
:term 132
:term
Page width: 132
Page depth: 9999
```

The depth stayed at 9999 because only the width was given.

### SD's default page is 120 × 36

***NOT 80 × 24.*** SD's default terminal size is **120 columns by 36 lines**,
and it is not a cosmetic choice: the shipped `@` dictionary records and the
default `list` report layouts are formatted for that width. A report that looks
wrapped or truncated on a narrow window is usually the window, not the report.

**Where the number comes from**, in order, when a session starts:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1 | the `LINES` and `COLUMNS` environment variables, if they are numeric |
| 2 | otherwise the terminfo entry's `lines` and `cols` |
| 3 | **otherwise 36 and 120** |

and whatever comes out is then raised to the minimum of 10 lines by 20 columns
if it is smaller. So an ssh session or a console window normally gets its real
size, and **120 × 36 is what SD falls back to when nothing else answers** — a
phantom, a piped script, a service.

> ***AND `term default` DOES NOT GIVE YOU 120 × 36. IT GIVES 20 × 24.***
> Measured, and it is not an artefact of how these listings were taken — the
> verb sets the **minimum** width and a fixed depth rather than the defaults:
>
> ```
> :term default
> :term
> Page width: 20
> Page depth: 24
> ```
>
> **`term 120,36` is what actually restores the default.** The constants for
> 120 and 36 exist and are the ones the login path uses; `term default` reaches
> for a different pair. This is a defect and it is upstream's as well as ours —
> it is recorded in the project's fix lists. Until it is fixed, treat `term
> default` as *"make the page as small as it will go"*, which is rarely what
> anybody wants.

**`Device`** is the terminfo entry in use, `windows` on this port. If a terminal
type has no terminfo entry SD falls back to `windows` rather than failing, so
this line is worth reading when screen handling misbehaves.

## The wire: `pterm`

```
:pterm display
Break trapping: On  (char ^C)
Case inversion: Off
Input newline:  CR
Output newline: CRLF
Binary mode (client to server): Off
Binary mode (server to client): Off
Telnet negotiation: Off
```

***`pterm` WITH NO KEYWORD PRINTS NOTHING.*** It is not a display verb that has
gone quiet — it takes a keyword and `display` is one of them. The full set:

| | |
|---|---|
| **`pterm display`** | the settings above |
| **`pterm lptr`** | send them to the default printer |
| **`pterm break on`** \| **`off`** \| *c* | enable, disable, or set the break character |
| **`pterm case invert`** \| **`noinvert`** | case inversion on input |
| **`pterm newline cr`** \| **`lf`** \| **`crlf`** | the output line ending |
| **`pterm return cr`** \| **`lf`** | the input line ending |
| **`pterm binary on`** \| **`off`** | pass bytes through untranslated |
| **`pterm telnet on`** \| **`off`** | recognise `TN_IAC` |
| **`pterm reset`** *string* | the terminal reset string |
| **`pterm prompt`** `":"` `"::"` | change the command prompt and the continuation prompt |

**Input `CR`, output `CRLF` is the shipped setting** and it matches what SD
writes to everything else externally readable on this port.

***`pterm break off` DISABLES THE BREAK KEY FOR THE SESSION.*** It is the right
thing before a job that must not be interrupted and the wrong thing to leave
set, because it is also how you stop a runaway program.

## Silence: `hush`

```
hush on
hush off
hush expression
```

**`hush on` discards output entirely** — it does not redirect it, and nothing is
kept. With no argument it toggles.

***IT SUPPRESSES THE COMMAND ECHO AS WELL AS THE OUTPUT***, which is more
thorough than people expect. In the measurement below, `who` was typed **twice**
— once inside the silence and once after it — and the transcript contains one:

```
:hush on
:who
14 DON
:term 132
```

The first `who`, and `hush off` itself, produced no line at all. **If you are
debugging a script that has gone quiet, an unmatched `hush on` looks exactly
like a hang.**

## The bell

```
bell on
bell off
```

Sets or clears the character SD sends to sound the terminal bell. **Neither form
prints anything**, and `bell` with no keyword is an error rather than a toggle:
*Mode keyword missing or invalid*.

## Clearing type-ahead and stored prompts

```
clearinput      clear.input
clearprompts    clear.prompts
```

**`clearinput`** discards anything typed ahead but not yet read.
**`clearprompts`** discards the inline prompt and response text a previous
command left behind. Neither prints anything.

***EACH HAS TWO SPELLINGS AND THEY ARE THE SAME VERB.*** `clear.input` and
`clear.prompts` are separate VOC records pointing at the same internal verb
number as the run-together forms, which is the pattern described on
[SD TCL - The Command Processor](19-sd-tcl-command-processor.html). Use
whichever reads better; nothing distinguishes them.

> ***NEITHER CAN BE DEMONSTRATED DOWN A PIPE, AND `clearinput` SHOULD NOT BE
> SENT DOWN ONE AT ALL.*** In a piped session the input stream *is* the script,
> so discarding unread input discards the commands that have not run yet —
> including the `off` that would have ended the session. **A run that did this
> hung, was killed, and left a session in the user table that only an elevated
> `sd -cleanup` could clear.** The listings on this page were measured with both
> verbs removed from the batch. They are for a person at a terminal.

## The inactivity timer

```
autologout
autologout n
```

```
:autologout
Autologout is disabled
```

which is the shipped state. Setting a timer ends a session that has been idle
too long — useful on a machine where people walk away from a prompt, and worth
thinking about before enabling on a machine where a long-running interactive job
is normal.

## The command echo: `echo`

```
echo on
echo off
echo
```

**`echo off` stops SD echoing what you type**; with no keyword it toggles.
Neither form prints anything, and `echo off` suppresses its own confirmation
along with everything else.

```
:echo off
:28 DON
:who
28 DON
```

That is one `who` under `echo off` and one after `echo on`. **The first has no
`:who` line above it** — its output ran straight on after the prompt — and
`echo on` produced no line of its own either, because the echo it restores does
not apply to the command that restores it.

***IT IS NOT `hush`, AND CONFUSING THE TWO WASTES TIME.*** `echo` decides
whether your **input** is shown back; `hush` decides whether SD's **output** is
shown at all. A session that has gone completely silent has `hush on` set; one
where the commands vanish but the answers still appear has `echo off`.

## Dates and times

```
date                    today, spelled out
date internal           today as SD's internal day number
date n                  day number n, spelled out
date some-date          that date's day number
time                    the time and the date
time internal           seconds since midnight
```

```
:time
14:10:34 27 AUG 2026
:date
Thursday, 27 August 2026  02:10pm
```

***`date` PRINTS THE TIME AND `time` PRINTS THE DATE.*** Both print both, in
different formats and a different order, and neither name says so. `date` is
the long spelled-out form and `time` is the short one.

**`internal`** on either gives the raw number a program would see:

```
:date internal
21424
:time internal
51088
```

the day number and seconds since midnight. **`date` with an argument is a
converter, and which way it converts depends on what you give it** — a bare
number is read as a day number and comes back as a date, anything else is read
as a date and comes back as a day number:

```
:date 20000
Monday, 03 October 2022
:date 4 jul 2026
21370
:date zznotadate
Invalid date format
```

`time` takes no argument other than `internal`.

### Which way round a date is read: `date.format`

```
date.format on | off | display
```

```
:date.format display
European date format is off
```

**`on`** selects European (day-first) date format for the session, **`off`**
returns to the default, and **`display`** reports which is in force. If a default
conversion code other than `D` is set, `display` names that too.

**`date.format` with no keyword prints nothing** — like `pterm`, it wants one.

**Setting the machine's date is a different thing entirely** — it is an
administrator verb, it changes the clock for the whole installation rather than
for your session, and it is in the **administrator documentation** under
*Accounts and Security*.

## Waiting

```
sleep n
sleep hh:mm{:ss}
```

A number is seconds; a time is *until* that time, rolling over midnight if it
has already passed. **`sleep` with no argument returns immediately** rather than
sleeping for ever — the argument parses as zero.

## Writing to the error log

```
logmsg text
```

Everything after the verb is the message. It prints nothing, and what it writes
is a stamped, attributed entry in the system error log:

```
27 Aug 26 13:13:31 User 11 (pid 1786, don):
   page 28 measurement
```

***THE USER NUMBER, THE PROCESS ID AND THE ACCOUNT NAME ARE ADDED FOR YOU***, so
a message does not need to say who wrote it. The log is
`C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys\errlog`, shared by every session, which makes `logmsg`
the right way for a phantom or a scheduled job to report something a person will
read later — there is no terminal to print to and no transcript kept.
