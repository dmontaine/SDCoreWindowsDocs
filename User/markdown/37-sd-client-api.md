Title: SD Client API
Subtitle: The sdclilib client library, its functions across four language bindings, and the server status codes.

The SDClient API lets an external application connect to SD, open
files, read and write records, execute commands, call subroutines,
and manage select lists — all through a single shared library.

**The API is not just for developers and administrators.** It is a
normal way for any account to use SD. A person running a custom GUI
program that talks to SD needs API access and may need nothing else.

## The library

Four DLLs are installed. They are built from one source: each pair is the same
code compiled twice under two output names, so the two files are not identical
on disk but behave identically.

| | |
|---|---|
| 64-bit | `sdclilib.dll` and `sdclient.dll` |
| 32-bit | `qmclilib.dll` and `qmclient.dll` |

The `*clilib` names are what existing applications ask for; the `*client` names
are for new work. **Renaming one to the other does not work**: an import library
records the DLL name its symbols come from, so an application built against
`sdclilib` loads `sdclilib.dll` whatever you call the file on disk. That is why
both names are built rather than one being a copy of the other.

> ***The architecture must match the application, not the machine.*** A 32-bit
> application on 64-bit Windows needs the 32-bit DLL. The 32-bit build is a
> shipping deliverable rather than a testing convenience.

### Where they are, and how to use them

```
C:\Program Files\SD\usr\clients\client64\     sdclilib.dll  sdclient.dll
C:\Program Files\SD\usr\clients\client32\     qmclilib.dll  qmclient.dll
```

**Nothing is put on the system PATH for you.** Copy the DLL your application
needs either **beside the application's own executable** or into
`C:\Windows\System32`. Those are the two supported routes and either works.

`usr\clients` holds the DLLs and nothing else — no import libraries and no
headers travel with them. The header, `sdclilib.h`, reaches every installation
anyway at `C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys\syscom\sdclilib.h`.

The 64-bit pair also appears in `C:\Program Files\SD\usr\bin`, beside `sd.exe`,
and that copy is byte-identical to the one under `usr\clients`. It is the
server's own, and it is not the copy you should be taking — with one exception,
which is the next section.

## Connection

| | |
|---|---|
| `SDConnect(host, port, user, pass, account)` | over the network, to port **4243** |
| `SDConnectLocal(account)` | on the same machine. Sends no password and never did |

> `SDConnectUDS` (Unix Domain Socket) appears in the header but is not
> applicable on Windows. The Windows port supports local and TCP
> connections only.

### SDConnectLocal has a requirement the other does not

`SDConnectLocal` starts a session by running `sd.exe`, and **it looks for
`sd.exe` beside itself** — in the directory the loaded DLL came from, not on
the PATH.

So a copy of the DLL sitting next to your own application will not make a local
connection: there is no `sd.exe` there. Two ways round it:

| | |
|---|---|
| Load the copy in `usr\bin` | it is beside `sd.exe`, which is why that copy exists |
| Use `SDConnect` instead | connect to `127.0.0.1` on port 4243 like any other client |

`SDConnectLocal` sends no password at all. It takes the identity of the process
that called it and checks that account's grants, so the account has to be one
the calling Windows user may enter.

**The login is SCRAM-SHA-256.** A client that sends a password in
clear is refused. The server sets a puzzle only someone who knows the
password can answer, and the password itself is never sent in any
form. The server also proves itself to the client — another program
that grabbed the port before SD started cannot pretend to be SD.

> ***Run `modify.password` again for every account that uses the API***
> after upgrading. The stored credentials changed shape and the old
> ones cannot be converted — the password was never kept anywhere, by
> design.

A session is confined to its own account. An API session can open
everything inside its own account and the shipped SDSYS files every
account needs, but cannot open, rename, delete or list anything else.

## Server status codes

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SV_OK` | 0 | success |
| `SV_ON_ERROR` | 1 | an `ON ERROR` clause fired |
| `SV_ELSE` | 2 | an `ELSE` clause fired |
| `SV_ERROR` | 3 | an error occurred |
| `SV_LOCKED` | 4 | the record is locked by another session |
| `SV_PROMPT` | 5 | the command issued a prompt and is waiting for input |

## Language bindings

The API headers define bindings for four languages. The function
signatures are identical in meaning; the syntax differs.

### Gambas3

```
Library "./sdclilib"
Extern SDConnect(Host As String, Port As Integer, UserName As String,
  Password As String, Account As String) As Boolean
Extern SDRead(FileNo As Integer, Id As String,
  ByRef Errno As Integer) As String
```

### PureBasic

```
PrototypeC.l P_SDConnect(host.p-utf8, port.l, user.p-utf8,
  pass.p-utf8, account.p-utf8)
PrototypeC.i P_SDRead(fno.l, id.p-utf8, *err)
```

Per-arity prototypes are provided for `SDCall` and `SDCallx`:
`P_SDCall0` through `P_SDCall20`, `P_SDCallx0` through `P_SDCallx20`.

### Free Pascal / Lazarus

```pascal
type
  TSDConnectFn = function(Host: PAnsiChar; Port: LongInt;
    User, Pass, Account: PAnsiChar): LongInt; cdecl;
  TSDReadFn = function(FileNo: LongInt; Id: PAnsiChar;
    Err: PLongInt): PAnsiChar; cdecl;
```

A `LoadSdCliLib` function loads the library and resolves all
function pointers; `UnloadSdCliLib` releases it.

### Python (ctypes)

```python
import ctypes
_lib = ctypes.CDLL('./sdclilib.dll')

SDConnect = _lib.SDConnect
SDConnect.argtypes = [ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_int,
    ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_char_p, ctypes.c_char_p]
SDConnect.restype = ctypes.c_int

SDRead = _lib.SDRead
SDRead.argtypes = [ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_char_p,
    ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int)]
SDRead.restype = ctypes.c_char_p
```

Per-arity `CFUNCTYPE` definitions are provided for `SDCall` and
`SDCallx` wrappers.

## What the API cannot do

| | |
|---|---|
| `sh` and `OS.EXECUTE` | refused over the API |
| Open files outside the account | refused (status 3035 — *not permitted*) |
| Reach the credential file | never, and cannot be added |
| Enumerate accounts | refused; all three failure cases give the same message |
