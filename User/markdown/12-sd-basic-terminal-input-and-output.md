Title: SD Basic - Terminal Input and Output
Subtitle: Writing to the screen, reading from the keyboard, and positioning the cursor.

This page covers what a program says to the person running it and what it reads
back: the output statements, the input statements, and the cursor and key
handling underneath them.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **The measured results on this page were produced by a program run down a
> pipe, which has no terminal.** Anything that needs a real one — `input`,
> `keyin()`, the editing keys — is described from the source rather than
> measured, and each such section says so. Everything shown as a measured value
> was produced on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## Output

```
print {on print.unit} expression {:}
crt expression {:}
display expression {:}
```

All three write a line. The differences matter only once a print unit is
involved:

| | |
|---|---|
| `print` | goes to the **current print unit** — the terminal normally, the printer after `printer on` |
| `crt` | **always** goes to the terminal, even while `printer on` is in force |
| `display` | a synonym for `crt` |

***THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON `crt` EXISTS.*** A report that prints its output
and shows progress on screen uses `print` for the report and `crt` for the
progress; using `print` for both puts "Processing record 400..." in the middle
of the printed report.

**A trailing colon suppresses the line ending**, so the next statement
continues on the same line:

```
crt 'Working' :
for i = 1 to 10
   crt '.' :
next i
crt ''
```

### Laying output out

The format qualifier goes straight after the value, with nothing between them:

```
print total '10r2'
```

Measured: `42 'R#8'` produced `␣␣␣␣␣␣42` — right-justified in eight columns.
The full specification language is in
[SD Basic - Data Conversion](06-sd-basic-data-conversion.html), along with the
warning that a value longer than the width **wraps** rather than truncating.

## The cursor

```
@(column, row)
@(code)
```

`@()` returns a string of terminal control characters. Printing it moves the
cursor or changes the display; it is not a statement.

***ON THIS PORT IT EMITS ANSI ESCAPE SEQUENCES.*** Measured: `@(0,0)` is six
bytes — `27 91 49 59 49 72`, which is `ESC [ 1 ; 1 H`, the standard cursor
positioning sequence. `@(-1)`, clear screen, is also six bytes.

| Code | |
|---|---|
| `@(-1)` | clear the screen and home the cursor |
| `@(-2)` | home the cursor without clearing |
| `@(-3)` | clear to end of screen |
| `@(-4)` | clear to end of line |
| `@(-5)` · `@(-6)` | cursor off, cursor on |
| `@(-13)` · `@(-14)` | reverse video on, off |

> **The sequences come from the terminal definition, not from a fixed table.**
> A session whose terminal type is wrong gets sequences the terminal does not
> understand and displays as literal text. `term` at the command line reports
> and sets the type.

## Screen geometry

```
@crtwide
@crthigh
terminfo(key)
```

`@crtwide` and `@crthigh` are the current width and height. Measured after
`term 200,9999`: **200** and **9999** — they follow whatever `term` last set,
which is why a program must read them rather than assume 80 by 24.

`terminfo()` reports a named capability of the terminal definition. Measured in
a session with **no terminal**, `terminfo('name')` and `terminfo('cols')` both
returned the **null string** — so a program that formats a screen from
`terminfo()` must cope with getting nothing back when it is run from a script
or the API.

```
save.screen(column, row, width, height)
restore.screen(saved, column, row)
```

save and restore a rectangle, for a program that pops a window over what is
already displayed.

## Input

***NOT MEASURED — THESE NEED A TERMINAL.***

```
input variable {, length} {:} {with prompt} {format} {then ... else ...}
input @(column, row) {, length} : variable
inputfield variable, length {, ...}
```

`input` reads a line. The optional *length* limits what may be typed and
returns as soon as that many characters arrive, without waiting for Enter.

| clause | |
|---|---|
| **append** | start with the variable's current value, so the user edits rather than retypes |
| **overlay** | as append, but typing replaces from the first character |
| **edit** | full line editing |
| **hidden** | do not echo — for a password |
| **panning** | scroll a field wider than the space it is shown in |
| **upcase** | fold what is typed to upper case |
| **timeout** *n* | give up after *n* seconds and take the `else` branch |

***`hidden` IS THE ONLY CORRECT WAY TO READ A PASSWORD.*** Turning the echo off
by hand with `echo off` leaves it off if the program aborts between the two
statements, and the user then types blind at the command prompt.

```
inputerr message
inputclear
cleardata
data expression
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `inputerr` | show a message on the status line without disturbing the screen |
| `inputclear` | discard anything typed ahead |
| `data` | **stack** a value for the next `input` to consume |
| `cleardata` | discard what `data` stacked |

`data` is how one program answers another's prompts:

```
data 'Y'
execute 'DELETE.FILE OLDSTUFF'
```

> ***A `data` VALUE THAT IS NOT CONSUMED STAYS STACKED.*** The next `input`
> anywhere in the session takes it — including a prompt the user was meant to
> answer. **`cleardata` after anything that might not have consumed it.**

## Keys

***NOT MEASURED — THESE NEED A TERMINAL.***

```
keyin()
keyinc()
keyinr()
keyready()
keycode()
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `keyin()` | wait for one keystroke and return it |
| `keyinc()` | as `keyin()`, but translate an escape sequence into a single key code |
| `keyinr()` | raw — no translation at all |
| `keyready()` | true if a keystroke is waiting; does not consume it |
| `keycode()` | the code of the key that ended the last `input` |

```
keyedit code, key.sequence
keyexit code, key.sequence
keytrap code, key.sequence
bindkey(key.string, action)
```

These attach a key to an editing action, an exit from `input`, or a trap.
`keycode()` then tells the program which one fired, so a form can act on F3
without reading raw escape sequences.

## Prompts and headings

```
prompt character
heading {no.eject} {on print.unit} text
footing {on print.unit} text
page {on print.unit} {page.number}
```

`prompt` sets the character SD shows when it wants input — a colon by default;
`prompt ''` suppresses it.

`heading` and `footing` are covered with the rest of the paging machinery in
[SD Basic - Printing](13-sd-basic-printing.html), because they apply to the
terminal and the printer in the same way.

## Echo and silence

```
echo on | off | expression
hush on | off | expression
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `echo` | whether typed characters appear |
| `hush` | whether **output** appears |

`hush on` suppresses output entirely — used around an `execute` whose chatter
you do not want. Both nest badly: they are a session setting, not a stack, so a
program that aborts between `hush on` and `hush off` leaves the session silent
and the user with no way to know why.

## Reading the command line

```
tclread variable
```

Returns the command line that started the program, so a verb written in BASIC
can parse its own arguments. `@sentence` holds the same thing.

## The port's terminal, in one paragraph

SD Core for Windows turns on the console's ANSI processing itself rather than
inheriting it, so `@()` sequences work in an ordinary PowerShell window without
the user configuring anything. Over ssh the session is a console session, so
the same sequences reach the client terminal. **A session with no terminal at
all** — the API, or a piped script like the one that measured this page —
**has no geometry and no capabilities**, which is why `terminfo()` came back
empty above rather than guessing.

## What is not here

| | |
|---|---|
| `ttyget()` · `ttyset` | **removed** — they exposed a POSIX terminal structure this port does not have |
| `connect.port()` | **removed** |
