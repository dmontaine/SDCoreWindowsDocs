Title: SD Basic - Debugging
Subtitle: Stopping a program where you want it, and looking at what it thinks is true.

SD has a real source-level debugger. It stops on a line, shows you the source,
prints any variable with its type, changes one, sets breakpoints, watches a
variable for change, and shows the call stack. It is worth ten minutes of
learning and it replaces most of the `crt` statements people leave behind.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

## Nothing works until you compile with DEBUGGING

```
basic bp MYPROG debugging
```

***THE `debugging` KEYWORD IS WHAT MAKES EVERY OTHER THING ON THIS PAGE
POSSIBLE.*** Without it the compiler emits no per-line debug information, and
the debugger has nothing to stop on. Measured, three ways:

| | |
|---|---|
| a `debug` statement in a program compiled **without** it | *"WARNING: DEBUG statement ignored - Not compiling in debug mode"*, **0 errors**, and the program **ran straight through** |
| the same program started with the `debug` **verb** | ran straight through — no prompt, no message |
| the same source compiled **with** `debugging` | stopped, and the prompt appeared |

The warning is a warning, not an error: the program compiles and runs. **A
`debug` statement in production code is therefore harmless but useless**, and
the tell that you forgot the keyword is that nothing happens.

**Recompile without `debugging` when you are finished.** The extra information
is per line, and the debugger becomes reachable by anyone who can run the
program.

## Two ways in

```
debug bp MYPROG          ;* the verb: stop on the FIRST line
```

Measured — the verb stopped before line 1 had run:

```
:DEBUG BP ZZDBG
 1:       crt 'ZZDBG.START'

>
```

```
      debug                ;* the statement: stop where you put it
```

Measured — the statement stops on the **next** line, the one that has not run
yet:

```
ZZDBG.START
 4:       n = n + 1

>
```

Use the verb when you want the whole program, and the statement when you want a
particular place — inside an `if` that is only true for one record, for
example. The statement is the only way to stop on a condition, because there is
no conditional breakpoint.

`>` is the prompt. `pdebug` is the same debugger for a phantom; the `debug`
verb refuses a phantom outright with *"Cannot debug program in a phantom
process"*.

## The commands, as this port prints them

Typing `help` at the `>` prompt gives:

```
BRK n           Set breakpoint on line n
CLR {n}         Clear all or specific breakpoint
DUMP var path   Dump variable to given pathname
HELP            Display this screen
ABORT or Quit   Abort program
EXit            Exit subroutine
EP              Exit program
Goto n          Goto line n
Run {n}         Free run or to line n
SRC {n}         Display line n, current line if n omitted
SRC {m,n}       Display n lines starting at line n.
STACK           Display call stack
Step .n         Step n debug elements
Step n          Step n lines
STOP            Stop program
Watch var       Watch for changes to named variable
UnWatch         Cancel Watch action
```

**The capital letters are the abbreviation** — `S` for `Step`, `R` for `Run`,
`G` for `Goto`, `W` for `Watch`, `UW` for `UnWatch`, `EX` for `EXit`, `Q` for
`Quit`. `?` is a synonym for `/` below, not for `help`.

## Looking at a variable

```
/name
```

A slash and the name. Measured, on three kinds of variable:

```
>/N
Integer: 41

>/K
String (9 bytes): "some text"

>/ARR(1)
String (5 bytes): "first"
```

***THE TYPE IS PART OF THE ANSWER, AND IT IS OFTEN THE ANSWER.*** `Integer: 41`
and `String (2 bytes): "41"` are different bugs, and so are `Integer: 1` and
`Float: 1.500000`. Measured on the rest of the shapes:

| | |
|---|---|
| a variable that has not been assigned yet | `Unassigned` — **not** an empty string |
| a name the program never mentions | `Variable not defined` |
| a floating point variable | `Float: 1.500000` |

The difference between the first two matters: `Unassigned` means the variable
is yours and has no value yet, and *"Variable not defined"* means you have
mistyped the name.

A matrix element takes its subscripts: `/ARR(1)` for one dimension,
`/ARR(2,3)` for two. `/` on its own repeats the last variable you looked at —
measured, it printed the same `String (4 bytes): "text"` again.

```
set name = value
```

changes it. Measured — `SET N = 100` then `/N` gave `Integer: 100`, and the
program carried on with the new value.

`dump var path` writes a variable to an operating system file, which is the way
to look at something too long for the screen.

## Stepping and running

| | |
|---|---|
| `s` | one line. Measured: the debugger prints the next line, `5:  crt 'ZZDBG.N=' : n` |
| `s `*n* | *n* lines. Measured: `s 3` from line 4 landed on line **7** |
| `s .`*n* | *n* debug elements — finer than a line |
| `r` | run on |
| `r `*n* | run on until line *n* |
| `g `*n* | jump to line *n* **without running the lines in between** |
| `ex` | run to the end of this subroutine |
| `ep` | run to the end of this program |
| `stop` | stop the program |
| `q` | abort. Measured: prints `ABORT : Debugging terminated` |

A measured `s` in the middle of an assignment sequence:

```
>/N
Integer: 41

>S
 5:       m = n * 2

>/N
Integer: 42
```

— the step executed line 4, `N` moved from 41 to 42, and the debugger is now
sitting on line 5.

## Breakpoints

```
brk 9        set one on line 9
clr 9        clear that one
clr          clear all of them
```

Measured — `brk 9` then `r`:

```
>BRK 9

>R
 9:       crt 'ZZDBG.N=' : n : ' M=' : m : ' K=' : k
```

`src` shows you the line numbers to aim at. Measured, `src 1,4`:

```
>SRC 1,4
 1:       crt 'ZZDBG.START'
 2:       n = 41
 3:       debug
 4:       n = n + 1
```

Breakpoints are on a **line number in the source**, so the source record has to
still match the compiled object. The debugger checks the modification time and
refuses with *"Unable to find source record"* if the source has moved on;
recompile rather than trying to work around it.

**There is no conditional breakpoint.** Put a `debug` statement inside the `if`
instead, and recompile.

## Watching a variable

```
w m          stop when M changes
uw           stop watching
```

***A WATCH IS THE ONE THING THAT FINDS "WHO IS SETTING THIS".*** Measured — a
watch set at line 4 and then `r`:

```
>W M

>R
 6:       k = 'some text'
Watched variable M has changed
Integer: 84
```

It ran on, and stopped **after** the line that changed `M`, telling you what it
changed to. That is the whole answer to the commonest hard bug in a long
program.

There is **one** watch at a time; `w` on another variable replaces it.

## The call stack

```
stack
```

Measured, from inside a program run from the command prompt:

```
>STACK
1: /cygdrive/c/ProgramData/SD/user_accounts/don/BP.OUT/ZZDBG @ 9
Command processor
```

The object path and the line, then whatever called it. From a program a
program can ask the same question without the debugger:

| | |
|---|---|
| `system(1002)` | the call stack as a dynamic array — one field per level |
| `system(1029)` | internal subroutine depth. Measured `0` at the top and `1` inside a `gosub` |

## It is a line-mode debugger here, and that is not a limitation of your terminal

***ON THIS PORT THE DEBUGGER NEVER DRAWS A FULL SCREEN.*** Its own test is
`terminfo('sreg')`, and `sreg` — *save screen region* — is a capability of SD's
own client terminals, not of a console. Measured, in a session on the shipped
`windows` terminal type:

| | |
|---|---|
| `terminfo('sreg')` | ***0 characters*** |
| `terminfo('cup')` | 16 characters |
| `terminfo('clear')` | 6 characters |

So cursor addressing is there and the region capability is not, and the
debugger takes its line-oriented path. **Nothing is lost** — every command
works, as the transcripts on this page show — and there is a real gain: because
it is line-oriented it can be **driven from a script**. A whole debugging
session can be fed down a pipe, which is how this page was measured.

`@tty` reads empty in a piped session, and the debugger works there anyway.

## Who has it

Read out of an account's own VOC:

| VOC entry | record | |
|---|---|---|
| `debug` | a `V` verb, `IN`, internal command 29 | run a program in debug mode |
| `debugging` | a `K` keyword, 53 | the compiler keyword |
| `pdebug` | a `V` verb, `CA $PDEBUG` | the phantom debugger |

***`debug` AND `pdebug` ARE NOT IN A STANDARD ACCOUNT.*** Both are on the
installer's `TIER.OMIT.STANDARD` list, so an account created at the standard
tier has neither verb. `debugging` is a keyword rather than a verb and is
unaffected — but with no `debug` verb, the `debug` **statement** is the only
way in on such an account.

## What is not here

***`trace` IS GONE.*** It was removed from the compiler in July 2024. Measured
in an ordinary account: *"Unrecognised statement"*.

***THE PROGRAMMATIC DEBUG STATEMENTS ARE RESTRICTED.*** `debug.on`,
`debug.off`, `debug.set`, `breakpoint` and `watch` are internal-only, and all
five measured as *"Unrecognised statement"* in an ordinary account. They are
what the debugger itself is built from. **`debug` — the plain statement — is
not restricted**, and it is the one you want.

`debug.info()` is internal-only for the same reason.

**No conditional breakpoints, no data breakpoints beyond the single watch, and
no remote attach.** The debugger runs in the session that runs the program.
