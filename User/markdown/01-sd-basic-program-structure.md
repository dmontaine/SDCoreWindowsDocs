Title: SD Basic - Program Structure
Subtitle: Programs, subroutines and functions; variables, matrices, common blocks and how a program is called.

This page covers the shape of an SD BASIC program: how it is declared, how it
is called, what its variables are, and the declarations that have to appear
before anything else.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every result on this page was measured, not quoted.** The values shown were
> produced by a program compiled and run on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## The three kinds of program

```
program {name}
subroutine name {(argument, ...)} {var.args}
function name {(argument, ...)} {var.args}
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **program** | runs on its own. Started by `run`, by its catalogued name, or from another program with `execute` |
| **subroutine** | called by `call`, and returns nothing. Its arguments carry values back |
| **function** | called inside an expression, and returns a value with `return` |

A source record with no declaration at all is a program. `end` closes it.

```
program hello
   print 'hello'
end
```

**`var.args`** allows the caller to pass fewer arguments than are declared;
`arg.count()` then says how many actually arrived, and reading one that was not
passed is an unassigned-variable error rather than a silent empty string.

### Local subroutines and functions

```
local subroutine name {(arguments)}
local function name {(arguments)}
```

These live inside the program that uses them rather than in the catalogue, and
they can declare `private` variables of their own — which is how you get a
routine whose working variables do not collide with the rest of the program.

***THEY ARE NOT CALLED THE WAY EXTERNAL ONES ARE.*** A local subroutine is
reached with `gosub name(…)` and not `call`; a local function must be declared
with `deffun … local` before it is used; and both need an explicit `return`,
because falling into the closing `end` stops the program. All of that, with the
scope rules and the errors each mistake produces, is on
[SD Basic - Modern Program Structure](18-sd-basic-modern-program-structure.html).

### Internal subroutines

```
gosub label
...
label:
   ...
   return
```

`gosub` is not a call to another program — it jumps within the current one, and
shares all its variables. The nesting limit is **256 levels**.

## Calling

```
call name {(argument, ...)}
call @variable {(argument, ...)}
subr(name {, argument, ...})
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `call name` | the name is fixed at compile time |
| `call @variable` | the name is taken from the variable at run time |
| `subr()` | the function form — use it where you want the result in an expression |

***ARGUMENTS ARE PASSED BY REFERENCE, NOT BY VALUE.*** A subroutine that
assigns to one of its parameters changes the caller's variable. That is how a
subroutine returns anything at all, and it is also how a subroutine that uses a
parameter as scratch space quietly corrupts its caller's data. **If you do not
intend to return a value through an argument, copy it into a local variable
first.**

Passing an expression rather than a variable — `call sub(a + 0)` — forces a
copy, because there is no variable to write back to.

```
catalogued(name)
```

reports whether a name can be called. Measured: `catalogued('ZZNOSUCH')` is
`0`. Use it before a `call @variable` whose name came from data, because an
uncatalogued name is a runtime abort rather than a testable failure.

## Variables

Variables are not declared and have no type. A variable holds whatever was last
assigned to it, and its type follows the value.

```
assigned(variable)
unassigned(variable)
vartype(variable)
```

| Expression | Result |
|---|---|
| `assigned(neverset)` | `0` |
| `assigned(zz)` after `zz = 1` | `1` |
| `unassigned(neverset)` | `1` |

**The compiler warns about a variable that is never assigned** — *"WARNING:
NEVERSET is not assigned a value"* — but it still compiles, and using the
variable is an error only when the line is reached.

### `vartype()`

Returns the internal type code. Measured:

| Value | Code | |
|---|---|---|
| unassigned | `0` | |
| an integer | `2` | |
| a floating-point number | `3` | |
| a string | `5` | |

The remaining codes exist for things a program does not usually inspect: `1`
address, `4` subroutine reference, `6` file variable, `7` array, `8` common
block, `9` image, `11` select list, `13` socket, `15` object.

> **`vartype()` tells you how the value is held, not what it means.** `'12'`
> read from a file is a string (`5`) even though it is a number everywhere it
> is used; the same value after arithmetic is an integer (`2`). **Use `num()`
> to ask whether something is numeric** — see [SD Basic - Math Functions](03-sd-basic-math-functions.html) —
> and keep `vartype()` for telling an unassigned variable from an empty one.

`set.unassigned` returns a variable to the unassigned state, which is how you
make `assigned()` false again after using it.

## Constants

```
equate name to value
equ name to value
```

`equate` is resolved at compile time and costs nothing at run time. It can name
a literal, another variable, or a matrix element:

```
equate true to 1
equate esc to char(27)
equate cust.name to record<3>
```

***AN `equate` IS A SUBSTITUTION, NOT A VARIABLE.*** You cannot assign to one,
and it is replaced wherever the name appears. `equate cust.name to record<3>`
means `cust.name` reads field 3 of whatever `record` holds at that moment.

```
$include file.name record.name
include file.name record.name
```

pulls in another source record at compile time. The system definitions live in
`syscom` — `$include syscom keys.h` for the key numbers used by `fileinfo()`,
`selectinfo()` and the rest.

## Matrices

```
dim name(rows {, columns})
dimension name(rows {, columns})
mat name = expression
mat name = mat other.name
```

A matrix is a fixed set of numbered variables, not a dynamic array. `dim` must
appear before any use, and the bounds are fixed at that point.

```
dim m(3)
mat m = 7          ;* every element becomes 7
```

Measured: after `mat m = 7`, `m(1)`, `m(2)` and `m(3)` all read `7`.

***A MATRIX HAS A ZERO ELEMENT AND IT IS NOT COUNTED IN THE DIMENSION.***
`dim m(3)` gives `m(0)` through `m(3)`. `m(0)` is where `matparse` puts
anything left over, and it is easy to forget it exists.

### Between a matrix and a string

```
matbuild variable from matrix {, start {, end}}
matparse matrix from string, delimiter
inmat({matrix})
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `matbuild` | joins the elements into one string |
| `matparse` | splits a string across the elements |
| `inmat()` | after `matparse`, how many elements were filled |

Measured, with `m` holding `7`, `7`, `7`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `matbuild bs from m` | the three elements joined with **field marks** |
| `matbuild bs from m, 1, 2` | the first two only |
| `matparse m from 'x' : @vm : 'y' : @vm : 'z', @vm` then `m(1)`…`m(3)` | `x y z` |
| `inmat()` after that | `3` |

> ***THE `using` CLAUSE OF `matbuild` DOES NOT WORK, IN EITHER CASE.***
> The documented syntax `matbuild var from mat using delimiter` compiles the
> keyword as a **variable name** and the program aborts at run time with
> *"Unassigned variable USING"*. Measured with both `using` and `USING`.
>
> **This is inherited, not introduced by this port** — the `st.matbuild` block
> in `BCOMP` is byte-identical to the one in the upstream `sdb64` tree. **The
> delimiter is always a field mark.** If you need another one, use `matbuild`
> and then `change()`, or build the string with a `for` loop.

`matparse` splits on the delimiter you give and stops when the matrix is full;
anything left over goes into element zero.

## Common blocks

```
common {/name/} variable, ...
clearcommon
delete.common name
```

Variables in a common block survive `chain` and are shared between programs
that declare the same block. An **unnamed** common block — `common // a, b, c`
— belongs to the program run and is cleared when it ends; a **named** one
persists for the session.

***`//` IS THE UNNAMED COMMON MARKER, WHICH IS WHY IT IS NOT AN INTEGER-DIVIDE
OPERATOR.*** See [SD Basic - Math Functions](03-sd-basic-math-functions.html).

`clearcommon` sets every unnamed common variable to zero. `delete.common`
discards a named block entirely, which is the only way to reclaim it within a
session.

> **A common block is matched by name and position, not by variable name.** Two
> programs declaring the same block with different variable lists will read each
> other's data at the wrong offsets, silently. **Put the declaration in an
> include record and `$include` it everywhere**, so there is one copy.

## Class modules and objects

SD BASIC has class modules with member variables, methods, properties,
constructors, destructors and inheritance. **They have their own page**, because
they are a different way of writing a program rather than a feature of this one:
[SD Basic - Modern Program Structure](18-sd-basic-modern-program-structure.html).

The short form:

```
class name {inherits base}
private variable, ...          public variable, ...
public subroutine name(...)    public function name(...)
get name                       set name(value)
end
```

```
o = object('CLASSNAME')
o->method(args)
o->property = value
```

***SD'S OWN CLIENT LIBRARY IS A CLASS MODULE.*** `gpl.bp/SDCLIENT` is 1,040
lines with 33 members and both lifecycle hooks — connecting to another SD server
from BASIC means instantiating it. *(An earlier version of this page said
nothing in SD used class modules. That was wrong.)*

## Arguments

```
arg.count()
arg(n)
set.arg n, value
```

These read the arguments of the **command line** that started the program, not
the arguments of a subroutine call. `arg(1)` is the first word after the verb.

## Discarding a result

```
void expression
```

Calls a function and throws the answer away. It exists because SD BASIC has no
statement form for a function call — `void kernel(...)` is the idiom you will
see throughout `gpl.bp`.

## What is not here

Nothing in the program-structure group has been removed from this port. The
`package` statements — `enter.package`, `exit.package` and `package` — went
before SD Core, and `varset` is present but is an internal debugging aid rather
than something application code uses.
