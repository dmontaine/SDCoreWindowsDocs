Title: SD TCL - The ed Line Editor
Subtitle: The editor that runs inside SD, needs no terminal, and can be driven from a script.

SD has three editors and they are all installed with it. **`ed` is the one that
runs *inside* SD**: it is written in SD BASIC, draws nothing, and needs neither
a terminal nor operating-system permission. That is what makes it the editor for
a phantom, an API session, a session driven down a pipe, and anything you want
to automate.

The other two are [edit](26-sd-tcl-edit.html) and [micro](27-sd-tcl-micro.html),
which hand the record to a full-screen Windows program. Use one of those when
you are sitting at a terminal and want to see the whole record at once.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part. **`ed`'s own
commands are shown in upper case**, which is how `ed`'s `HELP` prints them; it
folds case too.

> **Every listing on this page was produced by running it**, on SD Core for
> Windows W1.0-0, against a scratch record in an account's `bp` file.

## Starting it


```
ed {dict} file {record...} {no.query}
```

Naming the record opens it straight away:

```
ed bp zzed
```

```
bp zzed
New record
----:
```

`----:` is the prompt. A record that exists reports its length instead:

```
bp zzed
3 line(s)
```

**Omit the record name and `ed` asks for one**, and asks again after each edit
until you give it an empty answer. **Give several names and it works through
them in order** — the record after the current one is reached by filing or
quitting the one you are on:

```
ed bp zzed zzedb
```

```
bp zzed
3 line(s)
----: Q
bp zzedb
New record
----:
```

***A FILE NAME IS TRIED AS TYPED, THEN LOWER CASE, THEN UPPER.*** A file that
matches none of the three stops the verb before the editor starts:

```
ed nosuchfile zzed
```

```
File not found
```

`dict` edits the file's dictionary rather than its data. It is the same
addressing as everywhere else, and a dictionary with no such entry is a new
record like any other:

```
ed dict voc who.am.i
```

```
DICT voc who.am.i
New record
```

## The commands

### Making a record from nothing

`I` inserts one line after the current one. At the top — where a new record
starts — it inserts at line 1:

```
ed bp zzed
I * ZZED - a scratch record for the SD TCL editing page
I crt 'ZZED OK'
I end
T
P20
FI
```

```
bp zzed
New record
----: I * ZZED - a scratch record for the SD TCL editing page
Bottom at line 1
----: I crt 'ZZED OK'
Bottom at line 2
----: I end
Bottom at line 3
----: T
Top
----: P20
0001: * ZZED - a scratch record for the SD TCL editing page
0002: crt 'ZZED OK'
0003: end
Bottom at line 3
----: FI
'zzed' filed in bp
```

`I` **with no text** starts a multi-line insert instead, prompting `0001= ` for
each line until you enter an empty one. `IB` is the same as `I` but inserts
before the current line rather than after it.

### Moving about

| | |
|---|---|
| **`T`** | to the top — *before* line 1, so `I` inserts at 1 |
| **`B`** | to the last line |
| *`n`* | to line *n* |
| **`+`***n*, **`-`***n* | *n* lines forward or back |
| **`G`***n*, **`PO`***n* | to line *n*, the long ways round |
| **`G<`**, **`G>`** | to the first or last line of the block |

### Looking

| | |
|---|---|
| **`P`***n* | display *n* lines from the current line |
| **`PL`**{**`-`**}*n* | *n* lines relative to the current line |
| **`PP`***n* | *n* lines centred on the current line |
| **`PB`** | the block |
| **`L`** *string* | the next line **containing** *string* |
| **`F`**{*col*} *string* | the next line with *string* **at** column *col*, default 1 |
| **`M`** *pattern* | the next line matching a pattern |
| **`COL`** | a column ruler |
| **`?`** | where you are and what is set |

***`P` LEAVES THE CURRENT LINE AT THE LAST LINE IT PRINTED, AND THAT IS WHAT
THE NEXT COMMAND ACTS ON.*** It is the one thing on this page that catches
people, because "display" does not sound like a move. Measured — `P20` on a
three-line record, then `DE`, and it was **line 3** that went:

```
----: P20
0001: * ZZED - a temporary record for the SD TCL editing page
0002: crt 'ZZED OK'
0003: end
Bottom at line 3
----: DE
Bottom at line 2
```

`?` is worth knowing before you ask anyone else:

```
----: ?
File name           = bp
Record name         = zzed
Current line        = 3
No block defined
OOPS will undo 'I end'
Searches are case-sensitive
Expansion of non-printing characters : Disabled
Non-printing character entry         : Disabled
Verification of block actions        : Enabled
```

**Searches are case-sensitive until you say otherwise** — `CASE OFF` makes `L`
and `F` insensitive, `CASE ON` puts it back.

### Changing

| | |
|---|---|
| **`I`** {*text*}, **`IB`** {*text*} | insert after, insert before |
| **`R`** *text* | replace the current line |
| **`A`** {*text*} | append to the end of the current line |
| **`C/`***old***`/`***new***`/`{*n*}{**`G`**}{**`B`**} | change *old* to *new* in *n* lines. `G` every occurrence, `B` over the block |
| **`R/`***old***`/`***new***`/`… | the same, without moving |
| **`D`***n*, **`DE`***n* | delete *n* lines from the current one |
| **`DUP`** {*n*} | duplicate the current line |
| **`CAT`** {*string*} | join the next line onto this one |
| **`FORMAT`** | re-indent BASIC source |

The delimiter of a `C` command is whatever character follows the `C`, so a
change involving `/` can use `,` or `:` instead.

### `OOPS` undoes the last thing that changed the record

One step, and it names what it is undoing:

```
----: OOPS
Undoing 'DE'
```

`?` tells you in advance what it would undo, which is the line above reading
`OOPS will undo 'I end'`.

### Blocks

`<` sets the start of a block at the current line, `>` the end, `<>` makes the
current line a one-line block. Then `COPY` copies it after the current
position, `MOVE` copies and deletes the original, `DROP` deletes it, and `PB`
displays it. `<` at the top clears the block.

### Values on a line

A field is a line, so `ed` handles fields on its own. **A value mark and a
subvalue mark are single unprintable characters**, and a line holding them
displays as one run with a stray glyph in it. `EV` opens the current line as if
its values were lines:

```
----: EV
Editing values. Use SV to save changes or QV to discard changes
----: P20
0001: NAME
0002: Smith
0003: Jones
Bottom at line 3
----: QV
EV mode changes discarded
Returned from EV mode
```

`SV` leaves `EV` keeping the changes, `QV` discards them. Three levels are
available: values, subvalues, and the elements of a compound I-type.

**A mark is typed as `^` and its character code**: `^253` for a value mark,
`^252` for a subvalue mark, `^^` for a literal `^`. The line above was made
with `I NAME^253Smith^253Jones`.

### Leaving

| | |
|---|---|
| **`FI`** | write the record and end the edit |
| **`FIB`** | file it, then `basic` it |
| **`FIBR`** | file it, compile it, and `run` it |
| **`SAVE`** | write it and **stay in the editor** |
| **`Q`**, **`QUIT`** | end the edit, **discarding changes** |
| **`X`** | abandon the whole run when a select list is in use |
| **`FD`**, **`DELETE`** | delete the record from the file and end the edit |

```
----: FI
'zzed' filed in bp
```

***`Q` ASKS ONLY IF YOU CHANGED SOMETHING***, and it asks on the same line:

```
----: Q
Record changed - OK to quit? Y
```

Anything but `Y` and you are still in the editor. On an unchanged record `Q`
says nothing at all and returns to TCL.

> ***`SAVE` AND `FI` WITH A DIFFERENT FILE OR RECORD NAME ASK BEFORE THEY
> OVERWRITE***, and so do `FD` and `DELETE`. Written back to their own record
> they ask nothing at all, which is what lets `ed` be driven from a script.

### `XEQ` runs a TCL command without leaving the editor

`@FILE`, `@ID` and `@LINE` are substituted, so a command can be about whatever
you are editing:

```
----: XEQ ct @FILE @ID
bp zzed
1: * ZZED - a scratch record for the SD TCL editing page
2: crt 'ZZED OK'
3: end
```

***AND WHAT IT SHOWED THERE WAS THE FILED RECORD, NOT THE ONE ON THE SCREEN.***
The buffer at that moment read *"a temporary record"* — the change had not been
filed. `XEQ` runs outside the editor and sees the file, which is the answer you
want from `basic` and the wrong one from `ct`.

### `HELP`

`HELP` alone prints every command. `HELP` with a topic prints one:

```
----: HELP FI
FIle [[filename] record.id]
                Write record and end edit
```

### The command stack, and prestored sequences

Every command you type is kept. `.L` lists the stack, `.R`*n* recalls line *n*
to the top, `.X`*n* executes it again, and `.A`, `.C`, `.I` and `.D` append to,
change, insert and delete stack lines.

`.X` **with a file and record instead of a number** runs a *prestored edit
sequence* — a record holding one `ed` command per line:

```
ed bp zzseq
I ED
I L scratch
I C/scratch/altered/
I FI
FI
```

```
ed bp zzed
.X bp zzseq
```

```
bp zzed
3 line(s)
----: .X bp zzseq
0001: * ZZED - a scratch record
0001: * ZZED - a altered record
'zzed' filed in bp
```

***FIELD 1 IS A MARKER, NOT A COMMAND. IT MUST BEGIN WITH `E`*** — `ED` is the
usual thing to write — and `ed` refuses a record that does not with *"Record is
not a prestored edit sequence"*. Nothing was run for it above, and the
line numbers in error messages count it: an unrecognised command in **field 2**
is reported as line 2.

`PAUSE` inside a sequence stops it and `.XR` resumes, `.XK` abandons it;
`LOOP` repeats from a given line.

> ***A PRESTORED SEQUENCE IS NOT AN UNATTENDED MECHANISM.*** Measured: one bad
> command **abandons the rest of the sequence and then asks a question**, and
> the answer is read from wherever the session's input comes from.
>
> ```
> ----: .X bp zzs2
> Error - Unrecognised command at line 2 of prestored commands
> Did you mean to insert this text (Y/N)? N
> ```
>
> The same is true of a multi-line `I`, which is refused outright inside a
> sequence. **If you are driving `ed` down a pipe, give every command its
> arguments** — `I` with text, `FI` with no name, never `FD` — and it runs
> through without stopping.


## Who has it

**`ed` is a programmer verb.** A standard account does not have it, and does not
have `edit` or `micro` either — an account that runs an application does not
edit the records behind it.
