Title: SD Basic - Program Control
Subtitle: Conditions, loops, jumps, and handing control to another program or to the command processor.

This page covers the statements that decide what runs next: conditional
execution, loops, jumps, and the several ways one program starts another.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every result on this page was measured, not quoted.** The values shown were
> produced by a program compiled and run on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## Conditions

```
if expression then statement {else statement}

if expression then
   statements
end else
   statements
end
```

The single-line and block forms can be mixed — `then` on one line and `end
else` opening a block is legal — but a block that starts on one line must end
with `end` before the `else`.

***AN EMPTY BRANCH STILL NEEDS A STATEMENT.*** Use `null`:

```
read rec from f, id then null else stop 'missing'
```

> ***`and` AND `or` HAVE THE SAME PRECEDENCE AND ARE APPLIED LEFT TO RIGHT.***
> `a or b and c` means `(a or b) and c`, not `a or (b and c)`. This is not what
> C, Python, Java or SQL do, and it is the single most common way a condition
> in ported code changes meaning. **Parenthesise anything that mixes them.**
> The full precedence table is in [SD Basic - Math Functions](03-sd-basic-math-functions.html).

### `begin case`

```
begin case
   case expression
      statements
   case expression
      statements
   case 1
      statements
end case
```

**The first matching case runs and the rest are skipped** — measured: with two
identical `case n = 2` branches, only the first executes. There is no
fall-through and no `break`.

`case 1` is the conventional default, because the constant 1 is always true.
If no case matches and there is no default, nothing runs.

## Loops

### Counted

```
for variable = start to limit {step increment}
   statements
next variable
```

Measured:

| Loop | Values taken |
|---|---|
| `for i = 1 to 10 step 3` | `1 4 7 10` |
| `for i = 1 to 2 step 0.5` | `1 1.5 2` |
| `for i = 3 to 1` | **none — the body never runs** |

***THE LIMIT IS TESTED BEFORE THE FIRST PASS***, so a loop whose start is
already past its limit does nothing rather than running once. A fractional
`step` is allowed, but a fractional step that cannot represent the limit
exactly may stop one iteration early — count with integers and scale if it
matters.

`step` may be negative, in which case the loop runs while the variable is
greater than or equal to the limit.

### Conditional

```
loop
   statements
while expression
   statements
repeat
```

`while` continues the loop when the expression is true; `until` continues when
it is false. Either may appear anywhere in the body, more than once, and a
`loop` with neither runs until something in the body leaves it.

Measured: `loop / k += 1 / r := k / while k < 3 / repeat` produces `1 2 3` —
the test happens where it is written, so the body before it always runs at
least once.

```
continue
exit
```

`continue` starts the next pass; `exit` leaves the loop. Both apply to the
innermost loop only.

## Jumps

```
goto label
go to label
gosub label
return
return to label
```

Labels end with a colon at their definition and are written without one in the
jump. A label must be in the same program.

### `on ... goto` and `on ... gosub`

```
on expression goto label1, label2, label3
on expression gosub label1, label2, label3
```

Jumps to the *n*-th label, counting from 1.

> ***AN OUT-OF-RANGE VALUE DOES NOT FALL THROUGH — IT IS CLAMPED TO THE NEAREST
> END.*** This is the opposite of what most MultiValue documentation says, and
> it was measured on this port with two labels:
>
> | Expression | Where it went |
> |---|---|
> | `on 0 goto a1, a2` | **label 1** |
> | `on 3 goto a1, a2` | **label 2** |
> | `on -1 goto a1, a2` | **label 1** |
>
> **So there is no "none of the above" branch.** A value of zero — which is
> what an empty or non-numeric variable evaluates to — silently runs the first
> case. **Range-check the expression yourself before the statement**, or use
> `begin case`, which has a real default.

## Stopping

```
stop {message}
abort {message}
quit
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `stop` | ends the program and returns to whatever called it |
| `abort` | ends the program **and everything that called it**, returning to the command processor |
| `quit` | leaves the current command level |

`set.exit.status value` sets the value a caller can read, which is how a
program run from a script reports success or failure.

## Running something else

```
execute expression {capturing variable} {returning variable} {passlist} {rtnlist variable}
perform expression
chain expression
enter name {(arguments)}
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `execute` | runs a command **at a new level**; the current program resumes afterwards |
| `perform` | as `execute`, but the command shares the caller's level — it can see and change the caller's select lists and files |
| `chain` | replaces the current program; **nothing comes back** |
| `enter` | transfers to another program, also without return, but keeps the current level |

Measured: `execute 'WHO' capturing cap` puts the command's output in `cap`
rather than on the screen, one field per line — `dcount(cap, @fm)` was `1` for
a single-session `WHO`.

***A COMMAND THAT DOES NOT EXIST IS NOT AN ERROR YOU CAN CATCH.*** Measured:
`execute 'ZZNOSUCHVERB' capturing out` completes, and `@system.return.code`
reads **-1**. The program carries on. **Test `@system.return.code` after any
`execute` whose command name came from data.**

| clause | |
|---|---|
| **capturing** *var* | the command's output goes to *var* instead of the terminal |
| **returning** *var* | error messages go to *var* |
| **passlist** | the caller's default select list is handed to the command |
| **rtnlist** *var* | the command's select list comes back |

> **`chain` discards unnamed common by default.** The `chain.keep.common`
> option preserves it — `option chain.keep.common` — which is the setting a
> ported application usually needs.

## Waiting

```
sleep {seconds}
nap milliseconds
pause {timeout}
wake user.number
rqm {time}
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `sleep` | wait a number of seconds, or until a time of day |
| `nap` | wait a number of **milliseconds** |
| `pause` | wait until another process calls `wake`, or until the timeout expires |
| `wake` | release a process that is paused |
| `rqm` | release the processor briefly — the historical "release quantum" |

`pause` and `wake` are how two SD sessions coordinate without polling. The user
number `wake` needs is the one `@user.no` reports in the waiting process.

## Interrupting

```
break {key} {on | off}
break {key} clear
set.break.handler name
remove.break.handler
```

`break off` prevents the user interrupting the program; `break on` restores it.
**Every `break off` needs a matching `break on`** — they nest, and a program
that aborts between the two leaves the session with interrupts disabled.

`set.break.handler` names a subroutine to run instead of entering the debugger,
which is how a program cleans up rather than dying at an arbitrary point.

> **`break off` around a whole program is a trap, not a safety measure.** It
> also disables the interrupt during any `execute` the program performs, so a
> runaway query started from inside it cannot be stopped either. Turn it off
> around the critical section — the write, the transaction — and back on
> immediately.

## Doing nothing

```
null
rem text
remark text
* text
```

`null` is a statement that does nothing, for branches that must be present but
empty. `rem`, `remark` and a leading `*` are comments; so is anything after
`;*` on a line.

***`rem` IS ALSO A FUNCTION.*** `rem(a, b)` is the remainder — see
[SD Basic - Math Functions](03-sd-basic-math-functions.html). The compiler tells them apart by the bracket: a
`rem` immediately followed by `(` is the function, anything else is a comment.
**`rem (a + b) is wrong` is a comment**, and `x = rem (a, b)` is a syntax
error, because the space changes what it is.

## What is not here

These existed in OpenQM or earlier SD releases and **are not in SD Core for
Windows**. A program using one will not compile.

| | |
|---|---|
| `aborte` · `abortm` | abort with a message number or text |
| `stope` · `stopm` | stop with a message number or text |
| `rsd` | |
| `enter.package` · `exit.package` · `package` | |
| `trace` | |
| `errmsg` | see below |

***`errmsg` IS IN THE COMPILER'S STATEMENT TABLE AND STILL DOES NOT COMPILE.***
Measured: `errmsg 1000` is rejected with *"Unrecognised statement"*. The name
survives in `BCOMP`'s list but its opcode was removed, so the table is not a
reliable guide for this one — **being listed as a statement does not mean a
statement exists.**

`procread` and `procwrite` **do** compile, despite appearing on the SD 0.8.0
removed list; `procread` was restored afterwards. Both were checked, not
assumed.
