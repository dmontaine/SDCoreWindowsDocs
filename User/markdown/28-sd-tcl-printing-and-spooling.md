Title: SD TCL - Printing and Spooling
Subtitle: Print units at the command prompt, keeping a job open, and capturing a session instead of printing it.

Printing is set up at the prompt and used from a program. **This page is the
prompt half**: the verbs that point a print unit somewhere, hold it open, and
capture what a session displays. The statements a program uses — `print on`,
`heading`, `printer file` — are in
[SD Basic - Printing](13-sd-basic-printing.html), and nothing here repeats them.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
something you type as it stands.

## Print units, and where they point

**Unit 0 is the terminal.** Every other unit is somewhere you have sent it.
**`setptr`** is how you look and how you set:

```
:setptr display
Unit Width Depth Tmgn Bmgn Mode Options
   0    80    66    0    0    1 
```

| Column | |
|---|---|
| **Unit** | the print unit number a program names in `print on n` |
| **Width**, **Depth** | the page, in characters and lines |
| **Tmgn**, **Bmgn** | top and bottom margins, in lines |
| **Mode** | what the unit does with the output |
| **Options** | everything else that has been set on the unit |

**The depth is 66 and the terminal is not 66 lines.** Unit 0's page is a
printed page, not your screen — it is the size a report is paginated to when it
goes to a printer. The screen's own size is **`term`**, which is a different
setting on a different page:
[SD TCL - The Terminal and the Session](29-sd-tcl-the-terminal-and-the-session.html).

## Setting a unit

```
setptr unit, width, depth, top.margin, bottom.margin, mode {, options}
setptr default, width, depth, top.margin, bottom.margin, mode {, options}
setptr display
setptr unit, display
```

The positional arguments are all optional — `setptr 1,,,,,3` sets only the mode
of unit 1 — and **`nodefault`** keeps the values you did not name rather than
resetting them.

> **`setptr` asks before it changes a unit, and `brief` is how you stop it.**
> That confirmation is a prompt, so a `setptr` inside a phantom, a script or an
> API session **hangs waiting for an answer nobody is there to give**. Give it
> `brief` in anything that is not a person at a keyboard.

The options are many and most are printer-specific. The ones worth knowing at
the prompt:

| | |
|---|---|
| **`as`** *name*, **`as pathname`** *path* | the name or path a mode 3 unit writes to |
| **`at`** *printer* | the Windows printer to send to |
| **`brief`** | suppress the confirmation prompt |
| **`keep.open`** | hold the unit open between jobs — see below |
| **`copies`** *n*, **`landscape`**, **`portrait`**, **`duplex`** | passed to the Windows spooler |
| **`newline cr`** \| **`lf`** \| **`crlf`** | the line ending written |
| **`nfmt`** | send the data with no formatting at all |
| **`style`** *name* | apply a report style |

**`paper.size`, `cpi`, `pcl`, `symbol.set`, `weight` and `overlay`** are the
printer-formatting set and behave as they always did.

## The same settings in keywords: `printer`

```
printer {unit} query                    report one unit
printer {unit} at printer.name          send it to a Windows printer
printer {unit} file file.name record    send it to a record
printer {unit} width n | lines n        the page
printer {unit} top.margin n | bottom.margin n | left.margin n
printer {unit} keep.open | close
printer {unit} reset                    back to the defaults
```

**`printer` does the same job as `setptr` and does not ask first.** That is
the reason to know it exists: `setptr` confirms before it changes a unit unless
you remember `brief`, and `printer` has no confirmation at all. **It is the form
to use from a phantom, a script or an API session.**

More than one keyword may be given, in any order. The unit number comes before
the keywords and **defaults to 0**, the terminal.

**`query` is the per-unit report**, and it names things `setptr display`'s
columns do not:

```
:printer query
PRINT UNIT 0
   Page width     : 80
   Lines per page : 66
   Top margin     : 0
   Bottom margin  : 0
   Left margin    : 0
   Mode           : 1
   Printer        : (Default)
```

```
:printer 1 query
PRINT UNIT 1
   Page width     : 80
   Lines per page : 66
   Top margin     : 0
   Bottom margin  : 0
   Left margin    : 0
   Mode           : 3
   Target         : $hold P1
```

**The last line names the destination, and its wording tells you whether one has
been set:**

| | |
|---|---|
| `Printer        : (Default)` | mode 1, no printer named — the Windows default |
| `Printer        : `*name* | mode 1, that Windows printer |
| `Target         : $hold P`*n* | mode 3, nothing named — the unit's own hold record |
| `Pathname       : `*path* | mode 3, that destination |

`setptr display` shows none of this; it is a table of numbers.

Setting and putting back, measured in one session — the two `query` reports are
cut to the lines that moved:

```
:printer 1 width 132 lines 60
:printer 1 query
   Page width     : 132
   Lines per page : 60
:printer 1 reset
:printer 1 query
   Page width     : 80
   Lines per page : 66
```

**Nothing is printed on the way through** — the settings are the report, and
`query` is how you see them. `reset` puts width, depth and all three margins
back to their defaults **and clears the destination as well**: the printer name
on unit 0, the file and record on any other unit. *(Unit 1 above had no
destination set either side of the reset, so its last line reads `Target` both
times — that is the wording for "nothing named", not evidence that `reset` left
it alone.)*

| | |
|---|---|
| *Invalid print unit number* | `printer` with nothing after it, or a unit outside the range |
| *Unexpected token (%1)* | a keyword it does not know |
| *Printer name not recognised* | `at` with a name Windows does not have |

## Holding a unit open

```
sp.open
sp.close
```

By default a unit finishes its job and releases when the program closes it, so
two reports become two print jobs. **`sp.open`** sets the keep-open flag so they
become one; **`sp.close`** clears it again. The flag shows up in `setptr`'s
Options column, which is the way to check it took:

```
:setptr display
   0    80    66    0    0    1 
:sp.open
:setptr display
   0    80    66    0    0    1 KEEP.OPEN
:sp.close
:setptr display
   0    80    66    0    0    1 
```

**Neither verb prints anything.** The Options column is the only report you get,
and it is worth looking at — a keep-open flag left set is why a report
occasionally arrives stapled to the one before it.

## Printing records

```
spool file.name record.id... {lines n m} {lnum} {lptr n}
```

**With no ids it prints select list 0**, so the usual shape is a `select`
followed by a `spool`. With no file name at all it refuses rather than guessing:

```
:spool
File name required
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **`lines`** *n* *m* | print only lines *n* to *m* of each record |
| **`lnum`** | number the lines |
| **`lptr`** *n* | send to print unit *n* rather than the default |

## Looking at what is queued

**`sp.view`** shows the records in `$hold` and offers to print them.

**It is a full-screen form and cannot be driven down a pipe.** It asks for a
printer number, then whether to print, then a confirmation — three prompts, so a
script that runs it stops and waits. Like the screen editors, it wants a person
at a terminal. Everything on this page except `sp.view` can be scripted.

`$hold` is an ordinary directory file in the account, so a script that needs to
work with held reports can read it with `select`, `list` and `spool` instead.

## Capturing a session instead of printing it

```
como on record.name
como off
```

**`como` writes everything the session displays into a record** in the `$como`
file, which it creates in the account the first time you use it. Measured end to
end:

```
:como on zzcomo
COMO file activated to zzcomo
:who
11 DON
:date
Thursday, 27 August 2026  01:13pm
:como off
COMO file deactivated
```

and the record afterwards:

```
:ct $como zzcomo
$como zzcomo
1: COMO file activated to zzcomo
2: 
3: 11 DON
4: 
5: Thursday, 27 August 2026  01:13pm
6: 
```

**It captures the prompts and the echoes, not just the output.** The record is
a transcript of the session, which is what makes it useful for showing somebody
what you did — and it means a COMO of a long run is larger than the output
alone. **`como off` is captured too**, as the last thing before the file closes.

To capture one command rather than a whole session, `execute ... capturing` in a
program is the better tool — see
[SD Basic - Program Control](02-sd-basic-program-control.html).

## Report styles

```
report.style
report.style name
report.style off
```

A report style is a stored set of print settings applied by name. With no
argument the verb says what the default is:

```
:report.style
No default report style has been set
```

which is what a fresh account reports. **`off`** clears it again.

## Printing on this port

**A named printer is a Windows printer**, and printing goes to the Windows
spooler rather than to a POSIX print command. There is no `lp` and no PostScript
pipeline. The consequences for a report that assumed either are set out in
[SD Basic - Printing](13-sd-basic-printing.html#printing-on-this-port), and they
apply the same way to a unit set up with `setptr`.
