Title: SD TCL - Processes and Phantoms
Subtitle: Seeing what a session is doing, running work in the background, and taking a snapshot of a running program.

Every SD session is a process with a **user number**, and almost everything on
this page takes one. The number is not the Windows process id and it is not the
account name: it is SD's own handle on a session, it is reused after a session
ends, and it is what `pstat` and `pdump` both expect.

A **phantom** is a session with no terminal. You start one, it runs a command in
the background under its own user number, and what it would have displayed is
written to a file instead.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **The listings on this page were produced by running them**, on SD Core for
> Windows W1.0-0. The two exceptions are `phantom` and `pdebug`, and the reason
> is on the page: neither can be driven down a pipe, so both are described from
> their source rather than shown.

## What is not on this page

***SEEING OTHER PEOPLE'S SESSIONS, AND ENDING THEM, ARE ADMINISTRATOR VERBS.***
`listu` lists every session on the machine and `logout` *n* ends one, and
neither is in an ordinary account's VOC. They are documented in the
**administrator documentation**, under *Sessions and Locks*, which is a
separate set your administrator may or may not have given you.

**`logout` with no argument is the exception and every account has it** — it
ends your own session and is `quit` under another name. That is worth knowing
before typing it intending to list something.

What is here is **your own processes**: what this session is doing, work you
started in the background, and how to look at either.

## What a session is doing: `pstat`

```
pstat {user n} {level n} {no.page} {lptr {n}}
```

With no arguments it reports every session; **`user`** *n* restricts it to one.

```
:pstat
User Detail
  27 Account: DON
     Command: pstat
     $PSTAT 141 (262)
  12 (Not responding)
```

Each line under a user number is the account it is in, the command it is
running, and where in that command it currently is — program name, source line,
and the address in hexadecimal.

### The levels are additive

| | |
|---|---|
| default | the current program only |
| **`level 1`** | the whole **call stack** |
| **`level 2`** | the **internal subroutine** stack — where each `gosub` will return to |
| **`level 3`** | both |

Measured from inside a running program, which is where the levels are worth
having — at the prompt there is nothing on the stack but `pstat` itself:

```
User Detail
  27 Account: DON
     Command: pstat user 27 level 1
     $PSTAT 141 (262)
     Command processor
     /cygdrive/c/ProgramData/SD/user_accounts/don/BP.OUT/ZZMATH 34 (152)
     Command processor
```

Read it downwards: `$PSTAT` is running, called by the command processor, which
was reached by `execute` from the program `ZZMATH` at line 34, which the command
processor started. **`level 3` adds an indented line under each frame** for the
`gosub` inside it.

### `(Not responding)` means the process is gone, not busy

`pstat` does not read another session's memory. It **asks** — it posts an event
to the target and waits for the answer, for up to four seconds. A session that
never answers gets that line.

***THAT IS THE CHEAPEST WAY TO FIND A DEAD SESSION.*** A session killed from
outside SD keeps its entry in the user table and its slot is still counted;
`pstat` is what tells you nothing is behind the entry. User 12 in both listings
above is one of those. **Clearing it is an administrator's job** — reporting the
user number is the useful thing you can do.

## Running something in the background: `phantom`

```
phantom command
```

The command is everything after the verb. SD creates a new process, gives it a
user number, and answers at once:

```
Started phantom user 31
```

**Your session does not wait**, and the phantom has no terminal, so anything it
would have displayed goes to a **como** record instead — in the account's
`$COMO` file, named `PH`*n*`_`*ddmmyy*`_`*hhmmss* for the phantom's user number
and start time. `$COMO` is created if the account has not got one. The first
line in the record is the phantom's own banner:

```
Phantom 31 started at 14:22:07 27 Aug 2026
```

so a phantom that produced nothing else is still distinguishable from one that
never started.

| refusal | when |
|---|---|
| *Phantom command missing* | `phantom` with nothing after it |
| *Phantom processes cannot be started within a transaction* | inside `begin transaction` |
| *Failed to create phantom process* | the operating system would not create the process |

> ***A PHANTOM CANNOT BE STARTED FROM A SCRIPTED SESSION, AND THIS IS THE ONE
> TO KNOW.*** When SD is fed commands down a pipe, the phantom child inherits
> that pipe. The job then never completes — not even after the parent session
> has exited — and the only way out is to kill the process, which leaves an
> entry in the user table that needs an elevated `sd -cleanup` to clear.
> **`phantom` is for a person at a prompt, or for a program, and not for a
> piped script.** The listings above are quoted from the verb's own message
> texts for that reason.

**A phantom is not a scheduled job.** It runs once, now. Recurring work is a
Windows scheduled task that starts SD, and that is a different subject.

### What a phantom does not inherit

***A PHANTOM IS A NEW SD PROCESS, NOT A BRANCH OF YOURS.*** It is started with
`fork` and `exec` and goes through login of its own, so **nothing your session
holds in memory reaches it** — no `@`-variables, no unnamed common, no open
files, no active select list. **The command string is the only thing passed**,
through a record in SD's `$IPC` file, and the session's option settings go with
it only when the `INHERIT` option is set.

## What phantoms have I started: `status`

```
status
```

```
:status
There are no phantom processes started by this process
```

which is the answer in any session that has not started one. When there are
some, it prints a user number, the start time and the command for each:

```
User  Started            Command
```

***IT REPORTS ONLY YOUR OWN CHILDREN.*** It is not a system-wide view and it is
not `listu` — a phantom somebody else started does not appear, and neither does
one your session started before you `logto`'d somewhere else. The register it
reads is keyed by the parent's user number.

## Dumping a process: `pdump`

```
pdump n
```

Writes a snapshot of session *n* to a file and carries on; nothing is stopped
and nothing is lost. The file is `sddump.`*n* in the directory named by the
`DUMPDIR` configuration parameter, or in SD's own system directory when
`DUMPDIR` is empty, which is how it ships:

```
Dumping process state as C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys/sddump.27
```

It holds the `@`-variables, the current sentence and command, the call stack,
open files and their locks, and named and unnamed common — which is to say **it
holds application data**, and it is written where any SD user can read it.
Treat a dump as you would the data of the program that produced it, and delete
it when the question it was written to answer has been answered.

| refusal | when |
|---|---|
| *User number required* | `pdump` with no number |
| *Not logged in* | no session has that user number |
| *PDUMP not allowed for processes run under other usernames* | the `PDUMP` configuration parameter has bit 1 set and the session is not elevated |

**It is an event, not a call.** `pdump` marks the target and returns; the target
writes the file when it next looks at its event flags. A process that is wedged
somewhere that never checks will not produce one.

## Debugging a phantom: `pdebug`

```
pdebug                  attach to a phantom that is waiting for a debugger
pdebug command          start command as a phantom and attach to it
```

`pdebug` puts the SD debugger on **this** terminal and the program in a
**phantom**, which is the only way to debug something that has no terminal of
its own. With a command it starts the phantom for you; with none it waits for
one to ask for a debugger, and **`Q`** gives up waiting.

It refuses inside a phantom or an API session — *Phantom debugger can only be
executed from an interactive session* — because it needs a terminal to draw the
debugger on.

> ***DO NOT SEND `pdebug` DOWN A PIPE.*** It polls the keyboard while it waits,
> and in a piped session the input stream is the script, so it consumes the
> commands that have not run yet. Together with the phantom it starts, that is
> two ways for one verb to hang a scripted session. **It is described here from
> source for exactly that reason.**

The debugger itself — the commands it takes once it is attached — is in
[SD Basic - Debugging](17-sd-basic-debugging.html).

## Who has these verbs

| | |
|---|---|
| **standard** | `status` |
| **programmer** | `phantom` `pstat` `pdebug` `pdump` |

***THE ONLY ONE EVERY ACCOUNT HAS IS `status`***, and it reports nothing but
that account's own phantoms. The rest are programmer verbs: making a background
process, and looking at one.

**There are two gates and they are not the same one.** The tier decides whether
you have the verb at all; **elevation decides whether it does anything to
somebody else.** `pstat` will report any session; `pdump` *n* is yours to use on
your own processes and refuses for another Windows account's without an elevated
session.
