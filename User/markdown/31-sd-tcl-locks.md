Title: SD TCL - Locks
Subtitle: The two kinds of lock, giving back the ones your session holds, and what you cannot do without an administrator.

***THERE ARE TWO UNRELATED THINGS CALLED A LOCK, AND KNOWING WHICH IS WHICH IS
MOST OF WHAT THIS PAGE HAS TO SAY.*** They do not interact, and the names do not
make that obvious.

| | |
|---|---|
| **database locks** | on a record or on a whole file. Taken by `readu`, `readl` and `filelock` in a program, and by `ed` while it holds a record |
| **task locks** | 64 numbered flags, 0 to 63, with **no connection to any data**. A program takes one by agreement to keep other programs out of something |

The statements a program uses to take either are in
[SD Basic - Locks and Transactions](14-sd-basic-locks-and-transactions.html),
and this page does not repeat them.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

## Only one lock verb is in an ordinary account

***INSPECTING LOCKS AND FORCING THEM OPEN ARE ADMINISTRATOR VERBS.***
`list.readu`, `list.locks`, `lock`, `clear.locks` and `unlock` are not in a
standard or programmer account's VOC, so the names are not recognised at all.
They are in the **administrator documentation**, under *Sessions and Locks*,
which is a separate set your administrator may or may not have given you.

**What every account has is `release`**, which gives back locks this session
holds. That is the whole of the TCL lock interface for an ordinary programmer,
and the reason is defensible: a lock you took is yours to give back, and a lock
somebody else took is not yours to look at or remove.

## Giving your own locks back: `release`

```
release filename id {id …}
release filelock filename
```

It is the TCL form of the BASIC statement of the same name, needs no special
rights, and acts **only on locks this session holds**. The file is named the way
you would name it to any other verb.

```
:release
File  not found
:release voc
Record id required
```

**A record id is compulsory in the first form** — there is no *release
everything* at the prompt. `release filelock` *name* gives back a file lock,
which has no id to give.

***A `write` OUTSIDE A TRANSACTION ALREADY RELEASES THE RECORD LOCK***, so
`release` at the prompt is for the case where a program took a lock and ended
without writing — usually because you stopped it — and for a file lock, which
nothing releases implicitly.

## What to do when something is stuck

You cannot see the lock table without the administrator verbs, so the useful
sequence is:

| | |
|---|---|
| 1 | **`release`** anything you know your own session took |
| 2 | `status` and `pstat`, on [SD TCL - Processes and Phantoms](30-sd-tcl-processes-and-phantoms.html), to see whether the program you think is holding it is still alive |
| 3 | if it is not yours, **report the file and record to an administrator** — they can list who holds it and force it open |

***A DEAD SESSION'S DATABASE LOCKS ARE NOT RELEASED.*** A session killed from
outside SD keeps both its user-table entry and its record and file locks, so
everything wanting that record waits for a process that is not there. **Nothing
an ordinary account can type will clear that**, and guessing at it wastes time —
the recovery is an elevated `sd -cleanup`, which is an administrator's.

## Task locks, and why you will rarely meet one

A task lock protects something that is **not a file** — a nightly job, an
external resource, a sequence that must not run twice at once. Two programs
agree that lock 7 means *this job*, and the number carries no other meaning.

**Taking and releasing one is `lock` and `clear.locks`, both administrator
verbs**, so in practice task locks are taken from **inside a program** with the
BASIC `lock` and `unlock` statements, which any account may compile and run.
That is the route to reach for; the TCL verbs exist for an administrator
inspecting or clearing the table by hand.

> ***A TASK LOCK HELD BY A KILLED SESSION IS NOT GIVEN BACK BY `sd -cleanup`.***
> It stays held, by a user number nothing is behind, until SD itself is
> restarted — a defect, and it is recorded in the project's fix lists. If a job
> guarded by a task lock will not start again after a crash, that is the first
> thing to suspect, and clearing it needs an administrator.

## Who has these verbs

| | |
|---|---|
| **standard** | `release` |
| **administrator** | `list.readu` `list.locks` `lock` `clear.locks` `unlock` |

***THE SPLIT IS BETWEEN YOUR LOCKS AND EVERYBODY'S.*** Giving back what you hold
is something any session may do. Looking at the machine's lock table, taking a
numbered flag, or forcing another session's lock open are all administrator
verbs, and `unlock` needs an elevated session on top of that.
