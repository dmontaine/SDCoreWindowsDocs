Title: SD TCL - Programs and the Catalogue
Subtitle: Compiling SD BASIC, running it, and giving it a name you can type.

Getting from source to something you can type is three steps: **compile it, put
it in a catalogue, then call it by name.** Only the first is compulsory.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every listing on this page was produced by running it**, on SD Core for
> Windows W1.0-0, against a two-line program in an account's `bp` file.

## Compiling

```
basic {file} record
```

The file defaults to `bp`. What comes back names the file and record, then the
error count:

```
basic bp zzprog
```

```
Compiling bp zzprog
WARNING: Final END statement is missing
0 error(s)
Compiled 1 program(s) with no errors
```

***A WARNING IS NOT AN ERROR AND THE PROGRAM STILL RUNS.*** The line above is a
warning, the count says `0 error(s)`, and that program ran. **Read the count,
not the presence of output.**

`@system.return.code` is the number of programs compiled, and negative on a
fatal error.

**The object code goes into `bp.out`**, a separate file beside `bp`, one record
per program. ***ITS NAME IS LOWER CASE EVEN WHEN THE SOURCE RECORD IS NOT*** —
a source record `ZZPROG` compiles to an object record `zzprog`. That is this
port's naming, and it is worth knowing before you go looking for the object by
the name you typed.

## Running without cataloguing

```
run {file} record
```

```
run bp zzprog
```

```
ZZPROG OK
```

`run` needs the file and record name every time. It is what you use while you
are still writing the thing.

## The catalogue is what gives a program a name

```
catalog {file {call.name}} {program | *} {local | global | pcode} {no.xref}
```

Catalogue it and the name becomes a command:

```
catalog bp zzprog
zzprog hello
```

```
ZZPROG added to private catalogue
ZZPROG OK
```

**The program sees the whole command line.** `@sentence` in the program above
read `zzprog hello`, so arguments arrive as typed and the program parses them
itself.

### Three catalogues, and they are not the same

| | |
|---|---|
| **private** | the account's own. The default when no keyword is given |
| **local** | a VOC entry in the account, so the name works only there |
| **global** | `gcat` in the system account — **every account sees it** |

***GLOBAL CATALOGUING REQUIRES ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEGE, AND ON THIS PORT THAT
MEANS AN ELEVATED SESSION.*** Without it you get *"Command requires
administrator privileges"*. **The same gate applies to an implicit global
catalogue** — one chosen by a `*`, `!`, `_` or `$` prefix on the call name
rather than by the `global` keyword — so the prefix is not a way round it.

Private and local cataloguing need none of this and work in a programmer's own
account.

### Seeing and removing

```
map {all} {lptr {n}} {file {name}}
```

```
System catalogue map at 23:12:07 on 26 Aug 2026                    Page 1
  Catalogue name..................  Compiled.  Time....  ...Obj  ..Xref  ..Size
  ZZPROG                            26 Aug 26  23:12:07     189       6     195
                                                                Total:      195
```

`Obj` and `Xref` are the object-code and cross-reference sizes in bytes, and
`Size` is the total. An empty one says so:

```
Catalogue is empty
```

```
delete.catalog name... {global | local}
```

```
ZZPROG deleted from the private catalogue
```

> **`map` also takes a `file` option**, which writes the map to a file instead
> of the screen. **It asks before overwriting** — *"File xx will be cleared and
> overwritten. Continue (Y/N)?"* — so it is not usable from a script driving SD
> down a pipe.

## Formatting source

```
format {file} {record} {case}
```

`format` rewrites a BASIC source record with standard indentation. **It says
nothing at all when it succeeds** — no output is the success case, which is
worth knowing before you go looking for a confirmation that never comes. `case`
additionally applies case conversion.

With no record name it uses the active select list.

## Compiling dictionaries

```
cd {dict | data} file {i-type}... {no.query} {no.page}
cd local
cd all
```

`compile.dict` is the same verb under its longer name. It compiles the A, C, I
and S-type entries in a dictionary; with no names it does all of them, or uses
the active select list if there is one.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`cd local`** | every dictionary in the account |
| **`cd all`** | every dictionary visible from the account |

Compiling a dictionary is a performance step, not a correctness one: it is what
a query using those entries runs against.

## Named common blocks

```
list.common {all}
delete.common name
```

```
No named common blocks present
```

Named common survives between programs in a session, and `list.common` is how
you see what is holding memory. `all` additionally shows the system blocks and
is internal-only.

## The two that are not like the others

**`generate`** builds `$include` token definitions from a dictionary. ***It is
interactive*** — it asks for the token type, the prefix and several other
things — so it cannot be driven from a script.

**`debug`** runs a program under the debugger, taking the same arguments as
`run`. It needs a terminal and **refuses inside a phantom** with *"Cannot debug
program in a phantom process"*. The debugger itself is covered in
[SD Basic - Debugging](17-sd-basic-debugging.html).

## Who has these verbs

| | |
|---|---|
| **standard** | `format` `list.common` |
| **programmer** | `basic` `catalog` `catalogue` `cd` `compile.dict` `debug` `delete.catalog` `delete.catalogue` `delete.common` `generate` `map` `run` |

***A STANDARD ACCOUNT CAN RUN CATALOGUED PROGRAMS AND CANNOT MAKE THEM.*** That
is the whole point of the split: an application is deployed by cataloguing it,
and the people who use the application need none of the verbs on this page to
run it.

`format` and `list.common` are the two exceptions, and both are harmless —
one tidies source the account can already read, the other reports on the
session's own memory.
