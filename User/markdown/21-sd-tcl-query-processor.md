Title: SD TCL - The Query Processor
Subtitle: Choosing records, sorting them, and printing a report, without writing a program.

The query processor is how you ask a file a question from the command line. It
selects records, sorts them, formats them into columns and totals them, and it
does all of that from one line of typing.

**Twelve verbs on this page are the same program.** `list`, `sort`, `count` and
the rest are one catalogued program reached through fourteen VOC records, each
carrying a number that says which verb was typed. Two of the fourteen —
`select` and `sselect` — build a list instead of printing one and are covered in
[SD TCL - Select Lists](22-sd-tcl-select-lists.html).

SD folds case, so a query may be typed in either case. Commands and keywords are
shown here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every listing on this page was produced by running it**, on SD Core for
> Windows W1.0-0. The file being queried is `voc`, because it is the one file
> every account has and it is interesting enough to ask real questions of.

## The shape of a query

```
verb {dict} file {selection} {sort} {output fields} {modifiers}
```

Everything after the file name is optional, and the parts may be given in
almost any order. The shortest useful query is a verb and a file:

```
count voc
```

```
418 record(s) counted
```

**That number is particular to the account it was run in.** Every account has a
`voc` and no two need hold the same records — a standard account's is smaller
than a programmer's, and `SDSYS`'s is different again. The counts on this page
came from an administrator account.

## The verbs

| | |
|---|---|
| **`list`** | print the records |
| **`sort`** | print them in order |
| **`count`** | print how many there are, and nothing else |
| **`sum`** | total a field across the records |
| **`list.item`** · **`sort.item`** | print whole records, field by field, rather than in columns |
| **`list.label`** · **`sort.label`** | print in label format |
| **`search`** | select records by looking for text inside them |
| **`show`** | build a select list interactively |
| **`reformat`** · **`sreformat`** | write the selected fields out to another file |

`sort` is `list` with an order imposed; every other pair works the same way, the
`sort` half being the ordered one.

## Choosing records

`with` introduces a selection clause:

```
count voc with dispatch # ""
```

```
144 record(s) counted
```

That one counts the verbs in the account, because `dispatch` is a dictionary
entry that is empty for anything that is not a verb.

### The operators, and their synonyms

**SD accepts several spellings of each operator** and they are exactly
equivalent — the same token underneath. Each row below was run, and the
spellings in a row returned identical counts on the same data.

| | |
|---|---|
| equal | `=` · `eq` |
| not equal | `#` · `ne` · `not` |
| less than | `<` · `lt` · `before` |
| less or equal | `<=` · `le` |
| greater than | `>` · `gt` · `after` |
| greater or equal | `>=` · `ge` |
| matches a pattern | `like` · `matches` · `matching` |
| does not match | `unlike` · `not.matching` |
| sounds like | `said` · `spoken` |

`before` and `after` read well on dates and are the same operators as `<` and
`>`. All three spellings of *not equal* returned **331** on the same query, and
`<`, `lt` and `before` all returned **381**.

### Joining clauses

`and` (or `&`) and `or` join clauses. **Each clause repeats `with`:**

```
count voc with dispatch # "" and with dispatch # "CA"
```

```
47 record(s) counted
```

### Patterns

`like` takes the same pattern language as SD BASIC's `matches` — `0x` for any
number of characters, `1a` for one letter, `3n` for three digits, quoted text
for a literal. It is set out in
[SD Basic - String Functions](04-sd-basic-string-functions.html).

```
count voc with f1 like "V0X"
```

```
140 record(s) counted
```

> ***A PATTERN THAT IS NOT VALID SELECTS NOTHING AND DOES NOT COMPLAIN.***
> Writing that same query as `like "V]"` returns **0 record(s) counted** — not
> an error, not a warning. **Always prove a pattern against a case you know
> matches** before believing a small answer, and be especially careful of a
> query that returns zero when you expected few.

### Other ways to choose

| | |
|---|---|
| **`every`** | apply the test to every value of a multi-valued field |
| **`when`** | select values within a record rather than whole records |
| **`no`** *field* | records where the field is null |
| **`unique`** | one record per distinct value |
| **`no.case`** | compare without regard to case |

## Sorting

`by` sorts ascending, `by.dsnd` descending. Both take a field name, and both
may be repeated for a second and third key.

```
sort voc with dispatch = "OS" by @id dispatch processor
```

```
@ID.................   Dsp   Processor...............
!                      OS
sh                     OS
2 record(s) listed
```

`@id` is the record id, and it is a field name like any other.

## What gets printed

**Name the fields you want after the selection**, and they become the columns
in the order you name them. With no fields named, the file's default listing is
used — for `voc` that is a description built by the dictionary.

The column heading, its width and its format all come from the **dictionary**
entry for the field, not from the query. `Dsp` above is the display name of the
dictionary entry called `dispatch`.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`id.sup`** | leave the record id out |
| **`col.hdg`** *"text"* · **`display.name`** | override a column heading |
| **`fmt`** *"code"* | override the format |
| **`conv`** *"code"* | override the conversion |
| **`as`** *name* | use another dictionary entry's formatting |
| **`col.spaces`** *n* | change the gap between columns |
| **`vert`** | one field per line instead of columns |
| **`dbl.spc`** | a blank line between records |
| **`col.sup`** · **`col.hdr.sup`** · **`hdr.sup`** | suppress column headings, both, or the page heading |
| **`count.sup`** | suppress the trailing record count |
| **`det.sup`** | suppress the detail lines, leaving totals |

## Headings and footings

By default the page heading is **the query you typed**, followed by a page
number — which is genuinely useful on a printed report, because it says how the
report was produced. `heading` replaces it:

```
sort voc with processor = "$QPROC" by @id dispatch processor heading "QP verbs"
```

```
QP verbs
@ID.................   Dsp   Processor...............
count                  CA    $QPROC
list                   CA    $QPROC
list.item              CA    $QPROC
list.label             CA    $QPROC
reformat               CA    $QPROC
search                 CA    $QPROC
select                 CA    $QPROC
show                   CA    $QPROC
sort                   CA    $QPROC
sort.item              CA    $QPROC
sort.label             CA    $QPROC
sreformat              CA    $QPROC
sselect                CA    $QPROC
sum                    CA    $QPROC
14 record(s) listed
```

**That is the query processor listing itself** — all fourteen VOC records that
reach it, including `count`, which is a keyword record that doubles as a verb.

`footing` does the same at the bottom of the page. Both accept the usual
options inside the text for page number, date and time.

## Totals, averages and breaks

| | |
|---|---|
| **`total`** *field* | a column total |
| **`average`** · **`avg`** | the mean |
| **`max`** · **`min`** | the largest and smallest value |
| **`enum`** · **`enumerate`** | count the values rather than total them |
| **`percent`** · **`pct`** · **`%P`** | express as a percentage |
| **`calc`** · **`calculate`** | evaluate an I-type against the totals |
| **`break.on`** *field* | start a new subtotal group when the field changes |
| **`break.sup`** *field* | break on a field without printing it |
| **`grand.total`** *"text"* · **`caption`** | label the final total line |

`break.on` is what turns a flat listing into a report with subtotals; the field
it breaks on almost always wants to be a sort key as well, or the groups come
out scattered.

## Taking only some of the records

| | |
|---|---|
| **`sample`** *n* · **`first`** *n* | the first *n* records |
| **`sampled`** *n* | every *n*th record |

A sampled listing says so in its trailing line — `Sample of 3 record(s) listed`
rather than `3 record(s) listed` — so a partial report cannot be mistaken for a
whole one.

> ***`sample` TAKES THE FIRST RECORDS FOUND AND THEN SORTS THEM. IT IS NOT THE
> FIRST *n* IN SORTED ORDER.*** Adding `sample 3` to the sorted listing above
> returns `count`, `show`, `sort` — not `count`, `list`, `list.item`, which is
> what the first three of that report actually are. **The sample is taken during
> selection and the sort happens afterwards, on the sample.** Use it to see the
> shape of a report cheaply; do not use it to find the top three of anything.

## Where the output goes

| | |
|---|---|
| **`lptr`** {*n*} | to print unit *n*, 0 by default |
| **`crt`** | to the screen, overriding a default of print |
| **`no.page`** · **`nopage`** | do not pause at the end of each screen |
| **`file`** | to a file rather than a device |

Printing, print units and `$hold` are in
*SD TCL - Printing and Spooling*.

## Querying a dictionary

Put `dict` between the verb and the file name and the query runs against the
dictionary instead of the data. It is the quickest way to find out what field
names a file will accept:

```
list dict voc sample 14
```

```
@ID.................   TYPE   LOC...........   CONV..   NAME........   FORMAT   S/M
@ID                    D      0                         @ID            20L      S
NAME                   D      0                         NAME           16L      S
F1                     D      1                         F1             5L       S
DATA.NAME              D      2                         DATA Pathname  18L      M
...
Sample of 14 record(s) listed
```

`D` entries name a field by position, `I` entries compute a value, and `PH`
entries are phrases — stored fragments of query that expand where they are
named.

## Who has these verbs

| | |
|---|---|
| **standard** | `count` `list` `list.item` `list.label` `search` `show` `sort` `sort.label` `sum` |
| **programmer** | `reformat` `sreformat` `sort.item` |

Reading and reporting are available to every account; the two verbs that
**write** their result into another file are not.
