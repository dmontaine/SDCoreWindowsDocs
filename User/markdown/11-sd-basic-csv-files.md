Title: SD Basic - CSV Files
Subtitle: Reading and writing comma-separated data without hand-rolling the quoting.

SD has statements that read and write CSV directly, and they handle the two
things that make hand-written CSV code wrong: a separator inside a field, and a
quote inside a field. This page covers them.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every result on this page was measured, not quoted.** The values shown were
> produced by a program that wrote a CSV file, read it back and inspected the
> bytes, compiled and run on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## Writing

```
writecsv value1, value2, ... to file.variable then ... else ...
printcsv {on print.unit} value1, value2, ... {:}
```

`writecsv` writes one line to a **sequential** file — see
[SD Basic - Sequential Files](10-sd-basic-sequential-files.html) for opening
one. `printcsv` sends the same thing to the terminal or a print unit.

**The quoting is done for you, and it is conformant.** Measured — three
values, one containing a comma and one containing quotes:

```
writecsv 'a', 'b,c', 'say "hi"' to f
```

produced, byte for byte:

```
a,"b,c","say ""hi"""
```

A field is quoted only when it needs to be, an embedded quote is doubled, and
the result is what RFC 4180 specifies. **Do not build this by hand** — the
common mistakes are quoting nothing, quoting everything, and escaping a quote
with a backslash, and each produces a file that opens wrongly in a spreadsheet
rather than failing visibly.

A trailing colon on `printcsv` suppresses the line terminator, so several
statements can build one row.

## Reading

```
readcsv from file.variable to variable1, variable2, ... then ... else ...
inputcsv variable1, variable2, ...
matreadcsv matrix from file.variable then ... else ...
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `readcsv` | one line from a sequential file into named variables |
| `inputcsv` | the same, from the terminal |
| `matreadcsv` | one line into a dimensioned matrix, one field per element |

Measured: the line written above, read back with
`readcsv from f to v1, v2, v3`, gave exactly

| | |
|---|---|
| `v1` | `a` |
| `v2` | `b,c` |
| `v3` | `say "hi"` |

— a clean round trip, with the quoting removed and the embedded comma and
quotes restored.

`readcsv`'s `else` branch is end of file, as `readseq`'s is.

**The number of variables is fixed at compile time and the data is not.**
A row with more fields than you named loses the extras silently; one with fewer
leaves the trailing variables empty, which is indistinguishable from a row that
genuinely had empty fields. If the width varies, use `csvdq()` below and count
what came back.

## Splitting a line you already have

```
csvdq(line {, delimiter})
dparse.csv line, delimiter, variable1, variable2, ...
```

**`csvdq()` is a de-quoter, not a quoter. the name reads the other way.**
It takes one CSV line and returns its fields separated by **field marks**,
honouring the quoting. Measured:

| Call | Result |
|---|---|
| `csvdq('plain')` | `plain` — one field, unchanged |
| `csvdq('has,comma')` | `has` and `comma` — **two fields** |
| `csvdq('has"quote')` | `hasquote` — the quote was consumed as quoting |
| `csvdq('a;b', ';')` | `a` and `b` |

So it is the function to reach for when a line arrived from somewhere else and
you want it as a dynamic array:

```
fields = csvdq(line)
n = dcount(fields, @fm)
for i = 1 to n
   ...
next i
```

**There is no matching function that quotes a field.** To produce CSV, use
`writecsv` or `printcsv`, which do it as part of writing.

`dparse.csv` does the same split but assigns straight into named variables.
Measured: `dparse.csv 'x,"y,z",w', ',', p1, p2, p3` gave `x`, `y,z` and `w` —
the quoted comma correctly kept inside the second field.

## The separator

Every statement here defaults to a comma. `csvdq()` and `dparse.csv` take the
separator as an argument; a semicolon is common in locales where the comma is
the decimal separator.

> **A file whose separator is a semicolon is still called CSV by the program
> that produced it.** Look at a line before assuming the separator, and take it
> from configuration rather than hard-coding it — the same export from the same
> system changes separator when the machine's locale changes.

## Line endings

CSV written by SD ends each line with **CRLF**, measured in
[SD Basic - Sequential Files](10-sd-basic-sequential-files.html). That is what
RFC 4180 specifies and what Windows tools expect. Reading accepts either.

## What is not here

Nothing in the CSV group has been removed from this port. The whole group is
**new relative to the OpenQM 2.6.6 documentation** — none of these seven names
appears in its by-type list, so the old help is no guide to them.

Two behaviours were fixed in this port and are worth knowing if you are moving
files across from the Linux original:

| | |
|---|---|
| **reading** | a conformant CRLF file used to lose its last field on every row, because the stray CR stayed attached to it |
| **writing** | output is now CRLF, so a file SD produced conforms to the RFC its own documentation claims |
