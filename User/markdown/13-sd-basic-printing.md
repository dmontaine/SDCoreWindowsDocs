Title: SD Basic - Printing
Subtitle: Print units, headings and page breaks, and sending output somewhere other than the screen.

Printing in SD goes through a **print unit** — a numbered destination that can
be the terminal, a printer, a file or a spooler. This page covers directing
output to one, and the paging that goes with it.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every result on this page was measured, not quoted.** The values shown were
> produced by a program that directed a print unit into a file, wrote a report
> to it and read it back, compiled and run on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## Print units

There are numbered print units. **Unit 0 is the terminal.** Any statement that
produces output takes an `on` clause to choose a different one:

```
print on 1 'this goes to unit 1'
heading on 1 'so does this heading'
```

Without an `on` clause, output goes to the **current** unit — which is the
terminal until `printer on` redirects it.

```
printer on
printer off
```

`printer on` sends `print` to the print unit; `printer off` sends it back to
the terminal. `crt` ignores both and always writes to the screen — see
[SD Basic - Terminal Input and Output](12-sd-basic-terminal-input-and-output.html).

## Choosing a destination

```
printer file {on print.unit} file.name, record.name {then ... else ...}
printer name {on print.unit} printer.name
printer display {on print.unit}
printer close {on print.unit}
printer reset
```

| | |
|---|---|
| **file** | write to a record in a directory file |
| **name** | send to a named Windows printer |
| **display** | send to the terminal |
| **close** | finish the job and release the unit |
| **reset** | put every unit back to its default |

**The unit number goes after `on`, not first.** `printer file on 1 'REPORTS',
'DAILY'` is right; `printer file 1, 'REPORTS', 'DAILY'` is a compile error,
because the parser reads the `1` as the file name and then wants a comma it
does not find.

### Measured, end to end

```
printer file on 1 'ZZOUT', 'REPORT'
heading on 1 "REPORT PAGE 'PL'"
printer on
print on 1 'first line'
print on 1 'second line'
printer close on 1
printer off
```

produced a record of **4 lines**, the first of which was **`REPORT PAGE 1`** —
the heading, with `'PL'` replaced by the page number, followed by the two data
lines and the blank the heading leaves under itself.

**`printer close` is what actually writes the file.** Until it runs the
output is buffered in the unit. A program that ends without closing its units
gets them closed for it, but a program that opens a second job on the same unit
without closing the first merges the two.

## Headings, footings and page breaks

```
heading {no.eject} {on print.unit} text
footing {on print.unit} text
page {on print.unit} {page.number}
```

A heading is reprinted at the top of every page and a footing at the bottom.
Setting either resets the page counter and starts a new page — **unless**
`no.eject` is given, which is how you set a heading without wasting the page
you are on.

The text may contain codes, written inside quotes within the string:

| Code | |
|---|---|
| `'PL'` · `'P'` | the page number |
| `'D'` | the date |
| `'T'` | the time |
| `'N'` | suppress the automatic page break |
| `'L'` | a line break within the heading |
| `'C'` | centre what follows |

Because the codes are quoted inside the heading, the heading itself needs the
other kind of quote around it:

```
heading on 1 "SALES BY REGION 'L' 'D' 'C' PAGE 'PL'"
```

`page` forces a break, optionally resetting the number.

> **A heading is per print unit and it persists.** It stays set until it is
> changed or the unit is reset, including after the program that set it has
> finished. A program that sets a heading on unit 0 and exits leaves the next
> thing the user does wearing that heading. **`printer reset` on the way out**,
> or set the heading on a unit you also close.

## Asking about a unit

```
getpu(key, print.unit)
setpu key, print.unit, value
printer.setting(key, print.unit, value)
```

Measured on unit 0 in a fresh session:

| Key | Meaning | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | is the unit defined? | `1` |
| `2` | width in columns | `80` |
| `3` | length in lines | `66` |
| `15` | current page number | `1` |
| `1002` | lines left on this page | `66` |

Other keys worth knowing:

| Key | |
|---|---|
| `1` | mode — where the output is going |
| `4` · `5` · `6` | top, bottom and left margins |
| `7` | spooler flags — landscape, duplex, raw mode and the rest |
| `9` | form name |
| `12` | number of copies |
| `1003` · `1004` · `1005` | heading, footing and data lines per page |

`setpu` changes a setting; `printer.setting()` takes **three** arguments and
reports or sets a spooler-level setting. **Not every key is valid for every
call** — measured, `printer.setting(0, 0, 0)` fails with *"Unrecognised printer
setting key"*, because key 0 belongs to `getpu`, not to it.

**The width and length are the unit's, not the terminal's.** Unit 0 reported
80 by 66 in a session whose terminal had been set to 200 by 9999 — see
`@crtwide` in
[SD Basic - Terminal Input and Output](12-sd-basic-terminal-input-and-output.html).
A report that lays itself out from `getpu` and a screen that lays itself out
from `@crtwide` are reading two different numbers, and both are right.

## Capturing output instead of printing it

```
como on name
como off
```

`como` records everything the session displays into a record, which is the
simplest way to keep a transcript of a run. To capture the output of one
command rather than a whole session, `execute ... capturing` is better — see
[SD Basic - Program Control](02-sd-basic-program-control.html).

## Suppressing output

```
hush on | off | expression
```

Discards output entirely rather than redirecting it. It applies to the session,
not to a print unit, and it does not nest — the caution in
[SD Basic - Terminal Input and Output](12-sd-basic-terminal-input-and-output.html)
applies here too.

## Printing on this port

**A named printer is a Windows printer.** `printer name` takes the name as
Windows knows it, and the spooler flags in key `7` include a **raw mode** that
sends bytes straight through without the driver reformatting them — which is
what a line printer or a label printer needs.

**There is no `lp` and no PostScript pipeline.** The Linux original assumed
both; this port hands the job to the Windows spooler instead. A report that
worked by writing PostScript to a pipe needs a driver that accepts it, or raw
mode and a printer that understands what you send.

## What is not here

Nothing in the printing group has been removed from this port, but the
**destination model changed**: printing goes to the Windows spooler rather than
to a POSIX print command, and `printer.setting` keys that named a Linux
facility do not apply.
