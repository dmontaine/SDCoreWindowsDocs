Title: SD Basic - Select Lists
Subtitle: Building, walking, saving and combining lists of record ids.

A select list is a list of record ids held by the session. Building one and
reading it back is how a program processes a whole file, and how it picks up
the result of a query run at the command line.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every result on this page was measured, not quoted.** The values shown were
> produced by a program that created a file, selected it, saved and restored
> the list and deleted the file, compiled and run on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## The eleven lists

There are **eleven** select lists, numbered `0` to `10`. List `0` is the
default: every statement that takes a list number uses it when you do not say
otherwise, and it is the one a query at the command line leaves behind.

**A list is session state, not program state.** It survives the program that
made it, and a program that leaves one behind changes what the next command
does. **Clear a list you built for your own use** — see `clearselect` below.

## Building a list

```
select file.variable {to list} {on error statements}
sselect file.variable {to list}
selectn file.variable {to list}
selectv file.variable to list.variable
selectindex index.name {, value} from file.variable {to list}
formlist array {to list}
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `select` | every id in the file, in no useful order |
| `sselect` | every id, **sorted** |
| `selectn` | as `select`, but does not clear the list first |
| `selectv` | the list into a **variable** rather than a numbered list |
| `selectindex` | from an alternate key index — see [SD Basic - Alternate Key Indexes](09-sd-basic-alternate-key-indexes.html) |
| `formlist` | builds a list from a dynamic array you already have |

Measured on a file holding two records:

| | Result |
|---|---|
| `select f` then a `readnext` loop | `2` ids |
| `formlist 'X' : @fm : 'Y' : @fm : 'Z' to 7` then a loop | `3` ids |

**`sselect` sorts and `select` does not, and `select` is not in id order.**
It returns ids in whatever order the file's hashing puts them, which changes as
the file grows. **A report that must come out in order needs `sselect`**, or a
query with a `by` clause; relying on `select` to be ordered produces output
that is right on the developer's small test file and wrong in production.

## Walking a list

```
readnext variable {from list} {on error statements}
   then statements
else statements

readnext variable, value.position, subvalue.position {from list}
```

`readnext` takes the next id and moves on. **The `else` branch is how the loop
ends** — it fires when the list is exhausted.

```
select f
loop
   readnext id else exit
   read rec from f, id else continue
   ...
repeat
```

The exploded form — `readnext id, vpos, spos` — is for lists built from a
multivalued index, where the same id appears once per matching value and the
extra variables say which value matched.

**A `readnext` loop and a `readu` inside it is the commonest deadlock.** Two
sessions walking the same file in different orders will each hold a record the
other wants. Use `sselect` so both walk in the same order, and give the `readu`
a `locked` clause so at least one of them gives up rather than waiting — see
[SD Basic - File Handling](07-sd-basic-file-handling.html).

## Asking about a list

```
selectinfo(list, key)
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `1` | is the list active? |
| `3` | how many entries it holds |

Measured: after `select f to 3`, `selectinfo(3, 1)` is `1`; after
`clearselect 3` it is `0`.

**Key 3 is the only reliable way to count a file's records** — `fileinfo()` has
no record-count key. `select` the file and read `selectinfo(list, 3)`.

## Clearing

```
clearselect {list}
clearselect all
```

`clearselect` with no argument clears list 0. `clearselect all` clears all
eleven.

**Clear a list you no longer need**, especially list 0: a program that returns
to the command line leaving a list active makes the *next* command operate on
that list instead of the whole file, which is a confusing thing to debug from
the other end.

## Saving a list

```
savelist name {from list} then ... else ...
getlist name {to list} then ... else ...
deletelist name
```

A saved list is a record in the account's `&SAVEDLISTS&` file and outlives the
session.

Measured: `savelist` of a two-id list followed by `getlist ... to 5` and a
`readnext` loop on list 5 returned the same **2** ids.

> **`savelist` and `getlist` require a `then` or `else` clause, and the
> compiler's complaint does not say so.** Written without one, the error is
> *"Expected THEN or ELSE"* reported against whatever follows — which reads
> like a problem with the next statement. `else null` is enough:
>
> ```
> savelist list.name from 3 else null
> getlist list.name to 5 else stop 'no such list'
> ```
>
> `formlist` and `clearselect` do **not** take a `then`/`else` clause, so the
> four statements are not consistent with each other.

## Combining and comparing lists

```
selectleft index.name from file.variable
selectright index.name from file.variable
setleft index.name from file.variable
setright index.name from file.variable
```

These walk an alternate key index in either direction from the current
position, rather than building a whole list at once. `setleft` and `setright`
position at the start or end without reading anything. They are covered with
the rest of the index statements in
[SD Basic - Alternate Key Indexes](09-sd-basic-alternate-key-indexes.html).

```
listindex(list, delimiter, item)
indices(file.variable {, index.name})
```

`listindex()` picks one entry out of a delimited list. `indices()` reports
which alternate key indexes a file has, or the definition of one.

## Lists as data

A list can be filtered in BASIC rather than by building a query string — which
is usually clearer, and cannot be broken by a value containing a quote.
`formlist` is the way back in.

```
select f to 2
keep = ''
loop
   readnext id from 2 else exit
   if id[1,3] = 'abc' then keep := id : @fm
repeat
keep = trim(keep, @fm, 'T')          ;* see the warning below
formlist keep to 3
```

> **`selectv` does not give you a dynamic array.** It puts the list into a
> variable of its own kind: measured, `vartype()` of a `selectv` target is
> **11**, a select list. Concatenating it or calling `dcount()` on it fails
> with *"Data cannot be converted to a string"*. **Read it with
> `readnext variable from list.variable`** — measured, that returns the same
> three ids. `selectv` is for passing a list to a subroutine, not for
> inspecting one.

> **A trailing field mark becomes an extra, empty id.** Measured: an array
> of three ids built with `keep := id : @fm` ends in a mark, and
> `formlist keep to 3` produced **four** entries — the fourth being the null
> string, which then reads a record that does not exist. **Strip the trailing
> mark**, or append the mark *before* each id except the first.

## What is not here

Nothing in the select-list group has been removed from this port.
