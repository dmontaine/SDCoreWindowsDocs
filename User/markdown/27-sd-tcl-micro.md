Title: SD TCL - The micro Screen Editor
Subtitle: The capable one — SD BASIC highlighting, a command bar, split windows and a help screen.

```
micro {dict} file record
```

`micro` opens a record in **micro**, a full-screen editor that does rather more
than [edit](26-sd-tcl-edit.html) does. Two things make it the one to use for
programming:

| | |
|---|---|
| **it highlights SD BASIC** | statements, reserved words, intrinsics, strings and comments, from rules SD generates out of the compiler's own tables and ships |
| **it has a command bar and a help screen** | so everything it can do is reachable and readable without leaving the editor |

It also has multiple files open at once, split windows, a plugin system and
rebindable keys. **If you only want to change one line in a record**, `edit` is
less to think about.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **The keys below are micro's own**, read from the default bindings and the
> help text inside the executable SD installs — **micro 2.0.15**. The SD half of
> the page was measured on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## Both editors are installed with SD

**You do not install anything.** SD's installer checks for both editors and
installs whichever is missing, machine-wide, so every account SD creates can
reach them.

If that could not happen — an offline machine, or one whose policy blocks the
package manager — the verb says so and names the command that installs it,
rather than opening nothing and reporting the record unchanged.

## The keys

`Ctrl-S` saves, `Ctrl-Q` quits, and **`Ctrl-G` opens the help screen**, which is
the answer to everything not on this page.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`Ctrl-S`** | save |
| **`Ctrl-Q`** | close the file — and quit, if it is the last one open |
| **`Ctrl-G`** | open and close **help** |
| **`Ctrl-E`** | the **command bar** — see below |
| **`Alt-G`** | show and hide the key hints |
| **`Ctrl-Z`** · **`Ctrl-Y`** | undo · redo |
| **`Ctrl-X`** · **`Ctrl-C`** · **`Ctrl-V`** | cut · copy · paste |
| **`Ctrl-K`** · **`Ctrl-D`** | cut the current line · duplicate it |
| **`Ctrl-A`** | select all |
| **`Ctrl-F`** | find |
| **`Ctrl-N`** · **`Ctrl-P`** | find next · find previous |
| **`Ctrl-O`** | open a file |
| **`Ctrl-T`** | open a new tab |
| **`Alt-A`** · **`Alt-E`** | start · end of line |
| **`Alt-B`** · **`Alt-F`** | previous · next word |

Function keys work too, for anyone who prefers them: **`F1`** help, **`F2`**
save, **`F3`** or **`F7`** find, **`F4`** or **`F10`** quit.

> **`Ctrl-Q` closes the file rather than the editor.** With one record open —
> which is how SD starts it — that is the same thing. With a second file opened
> by hand it is not, and micro stays up until the last one is closed.

## The command bar

**`Ctrl-E`** opens a `>` prompt at the foot of the screen. It takes micro's own
commands, and the two worth knowing on the first day are:

| | |
|---|---|
| `> help` | the same screen as `Ctrl-G` |
| `> help keybindings` | every key, including the ones not listed above |
| `> set` *option* *value* | change a setting for this session |

## Saving is broken for an ordinary account in W1.0-0

> **`micro` draws, edits and highlights correctly and then cannot save**,
> unless the session is elevated:
>
> ```
> Permission denied. Save with sudo not supported on Windows
> ```
>
> **The record you were editing is not touched and nothing is lost** — the
> failure is on micro's side of the working copy, and quitting without saving
> leaves the record exactly as it was.
>
> **It is not a permission problem with your file or your account.** SD points
> micro's configuration directory at a folder under `C:\Program Files`, which
> micro has to write to and an ordinary account may not. Measured 27 Aug 2026;
> it is recorded as a release blocker in the project's fix lists.
>
> **Until it is fixed, use `ed` for anything you intend to save.** It runs
> inside SD, needs no external editor and no operating-system access, and is
> documented on [SD TCL - The ed Line Editor](25-sd-tcl-ed.html). `micro` is
> still useful for reading a record with syntax highlighting.

## Highlighting SD BASIC

**SD SHIPS THE RULES AND POINTS micro AT THEM.** They are generated from the
BASIC compiler's own tables rather than typed by hand, so the list of
statements, reserved words and intrinsics is the one the compiler actually
accepts.

**It works on a record from a `bp` file and not on other records**, and the
reason is worth knowing: micro decides which language a file is by matching its
*name*, and a record called `MY.REPORT` tells it nothing. So SD names the
working copy `*record*.editing.sdbasic`, and that suffix is what micro
recognises. A record edited out of any other file is plain text.

## What SD does around the editor

The two screen editors are **one SD program with two names**. The working copy,
the save and compile questions, the two permission gates and the refusals are
the same for both, and they are set out on
[SD TCL - The edit Screen Editor](26-sd-tcl-edit.html#what-sd-does-around-the-editor).

In short: the record is copied into `$hold`, micro is run on the copy, and on
the way out SD asks whether to save it and — for a `bp` record — whether to
compile and catalogue it. Both verbs need `OS.EXECUTE` permission and a real
terminal, and refuse a session driven down a pipe:

```
:micro bp zzed
micro needs a terminal to draw on, and this session has none.
ed, the line editor, works anywhere.
```

## Marks, and how to type one

A **field** mark is a line break, so micro handles fields on its own. The other
three have a token you type instead. **Every token is `~` and one more
character, and `~` is the only escape character.**

| | |
|---|---|
| `~~` | a value mark |
| `` ~` `` | a subvalue mark |
| `~!` | a text mark |
| `~-` | a literal `~`, where one would otherwise be misread |
| `~,` | a literal `,`, where one would otherwise read as a separator |

**Marks in a row are separated by a comma** — a text mark, a text mark and a
value mark is `~!,~!,~~`. The conversion is lossless: no record is refused and
none is mangled. The full rules are on
[SD TCL - The edit Screen Editor](26-sd-tcl-edit.html#marks-and-how-to-type-one).

## Who has these verbs

**`micro`, `edit` and `ed` are all programmer verbs.** A standard account has
none of them.
