Title: SD TCL - The edit Screen Editor
Subtitle: Microsoft Edit, a menu bar and a dozen keys — the one to reach for when you just want to change a record.

```
edit {dict} file record
```

`edit` opens a record in **Microsoft Edit**, a small full-screen editor that
ships with Windows. It has a menu bar, the shortcuts everyone already knows,
and nothing else to learn. **That is the point of it**: if you want to fix a
line in a record and get on with your day, this is the one.

It has no syntax highlighting and no command language. For SD BASIC source —
or for anything where you want highlighting, split windows, or a command bar —
use [micro](27-sd-tcl-micro.html) instead. For a session with no terminal, or
one you are driving from a script, use [ed](25-sd-tcl-ed.html).

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **The keys below are Microsoft Edit's own**, read from the source of the
> version SD checks for — **1.2.1**, which is what ships in current Windows.
> The SD half of the page was measured on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## Both editors are installed with SD

***YOU DO NOT INSTALL ANYTHING.*** SD's installer checks for both editors and
installs whichever is missing, machine-wide, so every account SD creates can
reach them. Microsoft Edit is usually already there — it is part of current
Windows, at `C:\Windows\System32\edit.exe`.

If that could not happen — an offline machine, or one whose policy blocks the
package manager — the verb says so and names the command that installs it,
rather than opening nothing and reporting the record unchanged.

## The keys

`Ctrl-S` saves and `Ctrl-Q` quits. Those two are most of what anyone needs.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`Ctrl-S`** | save |
| **`Ctrl-Q`** | exit |
| **`Ctrl-W`** | close the file |
| **`Ctrl-O`** · **`Ctrl-N`** | open a file · new file |
| **`Ctrl-Z`** · **`Ctrl-Y`** | undo · redo |
| **`Ctrl-X`** · **`Ctrl-C`** · **`Ctrl-V`** | cut · copy · paste |
| **`Ctrl-A`** | select all |
| **`Ctrl-F`** · **`Ctrl-R`** | find · replace |
| **`Ctrl-G`** | go to line:column |
| **`Ctrl-P`** | go to file |
| **`Alt-Z`** | toggle word wrap |

***THE MENU BAR IS THE HELP.*** There is no help screen — the Help menu holds
only *About* — and there does not need to be one: **`F10`** or **`Alt`** and the
menu's letter opens a menu, and every command is listed there **with its
shortcut printed beside it**.

| | |
|---|---|
| **`Alt-F`** | File |
| **`Alt-E`** | Edit |
| **`Alt-V`** | View |
| **`Alt-H`** | Help |

*Save As* is on the File menu and is the one common command with no shortcut of
its own: `Alt-F` then `A`.

## What SD does around the editor

The two screen editors are **one SD program with two names**, so everything in
this section is equally true of [micro](27-sd-tcl-micro.html).

| | |
|---|---|
| **the working copy** | the record is copied into `$hold` as *record*`.editing`, and the editor is run on that. It is removed on every exit, including the ones that fail |
| **saving** | *"Save? &lt;Y&gt;es, &lt;N&gt;o"*, then for a `bp` record *"Compile?"* and *"Catalogue?"* |
| **a `dict` record** | is always saved and re-compiled with `cd` |
| **finishing** | *"&lt;E&gt;xit or &lt;R&gt;e-edit"*, so a compile error can be fixed without starting again |

**A compiled dictionary record is truncated to its first 15 fields while you
edit it**, which is what you want: the fields after them are the compiled form,
and `cd` rebuilds them when you save.

## Marks, and how to type one

A **field** mark is a line break, so a text editor handles fields on its own.
The other three marks are single control characters an editor would either draw
as a stray glyph or drop, so each has a token you type instead.

***EVERY TOKEN IS `~` AND ONE MORE CHARACTER, AND `~` IS THE ONLY ESCAPE
CHARACTER.***

| | |
|---|---|
| `~~` | a value mark |
| `` ~` `` | a subvalue mark |
| `~!` | a text mark |
| `~-` | a literal `~`, where one would otherwise be misread |
| `~,` | a literal `,`, where one would otherwise read as a separator |

`SMITH~~JONES~~BROWN` is a three-value field; ``RED~`BLUE~~GREEN`` is two
values, the first with two subvalues.

### Marks in a row are separated by a comma

Written token against token a run of marks cannot be read, so SD puts a comma
between them. A text mark, a text mark and a value mark, one after another, is:

```
~!,~!,~~
```

**Type the comma yourself when you enter marks in a row.** It is a separator and
not data — which is why a literal comma standing in exactly that position,
between two marks, is written `~,`.

### The conversion is lossless

**No record is refused and none is mangled**, whatever it contains. A tilde is
written `~-` **only where the character after it would make the pair look like a
token** — another `~`, a backtick, a `!`, a `-`, a `,`, or a mark. Everywhere
else a tilde is left exactly as you wrote it, so `a~b` is still `a~b` and
ordinary source reads normally.

## Two gates, and both are separate from the verb

| | |
|---|---|
| **the VOC tier** | decides whether you have the verb at all |
| **`os.users` field 2** | the `OS.EXECUTE` field, decides whether it may run |

An editor runs outside SD, so it needs operating-system permission that `ed`
does not. It comes from a record in the system file `os.users` whose field 2
reads `yes`, **and only an administrator can put one there.**

***AN ADMINISTRATOR GETS ONE WITHOUT ASKING.*** An account created with the
**ADMINISTRATOR** tier — which is the tier of the account SD's installer makes
for whoever installs it — is written into `os.users` as it is created, with both
fields `yes`. So an administrator reaches the operating system **without
elevating**, and these two verbs work in an ordinary session.

**For an administrator it is a rule**, and it cannot be turned off. For every
other tier it is a grant, and there are keywords for it:

| | |
|---|---|
| **`create.account user`** *name* … **`os-on`** | give the new account `OS.EXECUTE` — and these two verbs |
| **`create.account user`** *name* … **`sh-on`** | give it the `sh` verb |
| **`modify.account`** *name* **`os-on`** \| **`os-off`** | change it afterwards |
| **`modify.account`** *name* **`sh-on`** \| **`sh-off`** | the same for the `sh` verb |

They are four switches over two fields rather than four names for one state, so
`sh-off` leaves `OS.EXECUTE` alone. **`modify.account` needs an elevated
session**, as it always has — you elevate to grant somebody the right not to
have to.

***THE FOUR REFUSE AN ADMINISTRATOR, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.*** An administrator
has all three routes — `ssh`, the API and the operating system — as a rule, and
none of them is `modify.account`'s to change:

```
:modify.account don os-off
don is an administrator and always reaches the operating system
```

It is the same refusal `ssh`, `api`, `both` and `none` already give for an
administrator, and it is deliberate rather than an oversight: the whole purpose
of the tier is that it grants unlimited access.

The record is ordinary data, so an administrator can also edit it by hand with
`ed os.users` *name* from `sdsys`. An account of any other tier starts with no
record and is refused until somebody grants it.

An elevated session passes anyway, whatever the file says — otherwise an empty
`os.users` would lock the machine's own administrator out.

***AND A SESSION WITH NO TERMINAL IS REFUSED BEFORE ANYTHING IS WRITTEN*** — an
API session, or a script driving SD down a pipe:

```
:edit bp zzed
edit needs a terminal to draw on, and this session has none.
ed, the line editor, works anywhere.
```

Both usage errors name the verb you typed rather than the program behind it:

```
:edit
No file name specified.  Usage: edit {dict} <file> <record>
:edit bp
No record name specified.  Usage: edit {dict} <file> <record>
```

## Who has these verbs

**`edit`, `micro` and `ed` are all programmer verbs.** A standard account has
none of them.
