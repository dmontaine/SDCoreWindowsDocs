Title: SD Basic - Sockets
Subtitle: Talking TCP from SD BASIC, as a client and as a server.

SD BASIC can open a TCP connection, and it can listen for one. That is enough
to call a web service, to feed a message queue, or to let another program talk
to your application without going through a file.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **Every result on this page was measured, not quoted.** A single program was
> both ends: it created a listening socket, connected to it, accepted the
> connection, and sent bytes through it — `create.server.socket` calls
> `listen()`, so a client can connect on loopback and wait in the backlog until
> the same session accepts it. Compiled and run on SD Core for Windows W1.0-0.

## The nine names

| | |
|---|---|
| `create.server.socket(`*addr*`, `*port*`, `*flags*`)` | bind and listen. Returns a **socket**, or 0 |
| `accept.socket.connection(`*server*`, `*timeout*`)` | take the next waiting connection |
| `open.socket(`*addr*`, `*port*`, `*flags*` {, `*context*`})` | dial out |
| `write.socket(`*socket*`, `*data*`, `*flags*`, `*timeout*`)` | returns the byte count |
| `read.socket(`*socket*`, `*maxlen*`, `*flags*`, `*timeout*`)` | returns the bytes read |
| `set.socket.mode(`*socket*`, `*key*`, `*value*`)` | returns 1 or 0 |
| `socket.info(`*socket*`, `*key*`)` | ask about a socket |
| `close.socket `*socket* | a **statement**, not a function |
| `server.addr(`*name*`)` | resolve a host name |

The `SKT$` constants are in `SYSCOM KEYS.H`, reachable with
`$include keys.h`. They are written out as numbers on this page so that what
was passed is visible.

## Opening the two ends

```
srv = create.server.socket('127.0.0.1', 45123, 0)
cli = open.socket('127.0.0.1', 45123, 0)
inc = accept.socket.connection(srv, 2000)
```

Flags `0` is TCP, stream. `0x00010000` selects UDP and `0x00020000` ICMP.

***BOTH FAIL BY RETURNING ZERO, NOT BY TAKING AN `else` BRANCH*** — they are
functions, and there is no `then`/`else` on them. Test with
`socket.info(`*s*`, 0)`, which is the one key that is safe to ask about a
non-socket:

```
srv = create.server.socket('127.0.0.1', port, 0)
if socket.info(srv, 0) = 0 then
   crt 'cannot listen on ' : port : ', status ' : status()
   stop
end
```

Measured failures:

| | |
|---|---|
| a port nobody is listening on | `socket.info` **0**, `status()` **7005**, and SD **printed** *"Failed to connect: 111: Connection refused"* to the terminal by itself |
| a second listener on a port already in use | `socket.info` **0**, `status()` **7012** |

**The refusal message is printed whether you want it or not**, which matters if
you are polling for a service to come up.

## What SOCKET.INFO tells you

| Key | Meaning | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | is this a socket at all? | `1` |
| `1` | kind: **1** server, **2** incoming, **3** outgoing | see below |
| `2` | port | see below |
| `3` | IP address | `127.0.0.1` |
| `4` | blocking? | **0** on every new socket |
| `5` | Nagle disabled? | `0` |
| `6` | keep-alive? | `0` |
| `7` | family: **1** IPv4, **2** IPv6 | `1` |

***KEY 2 MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND THE DIFFERENCE IS EASY TO MISS.*** On
the socket you dialled out with it is **the port you dialled**; on a socket you
accepted it is **the far end's ephemeral port**:

| | kind | port |
|---|---|---|
| `create.server.socket(..., 45123, ...)` | 1 | **45123** |
| `open.socket(..., 45123, ...)` | 3 | **45123** |
| `accept.socket.connection(...)` | 2 | **62602** — the client's own port, different every run |

## Reading and writing

```
n = write.socket(cli, 'hello world', 0, 2000)
d = read.socket(inc, 100, 0, 2000)
```

`write.socket` returned **11** for eleven bytes. `read.socket` returned the
eleven bytes.

***THE TIMEOUT ON A READ DOES NOTHING UNLESS THE SOCKET IS BLOCKING, AND NO
SOCKET STARTS OUT BLOCKING.*** This is the trap on this page. Measured on a
socket with nothing sent to it:

| the call | waited | returned |
|---|---|---|
| `read.socket(s, 100, 0, 5000)` | **0 ms** | nothing, `status()` 1011 |
| `read.socket(s, 100, 1, 2000)` | **2025 ms** | nothing, `status()` 1011 |
| after `set.socket.mode(s, 4, 1)`, `read.socket(s, 100, 0, 2000)` | **2018 ms** | nothing, `status()` 1011 |

A five second timeout was ignored completely. **Flag 1 is `SKT$BLOCKING` and
flag 2 is `SKT$NON.BLOCKING`; flag 0 means "whatever the socket is set to", and
a new socket is set to non-blocking.** Either pass `1` on every read that is
allowed to wait, or call `set.socket.mode(`*s*`, 4, 1)` once after opening.

**This is exactly the bug that passes its own tests.** On loopback, and in any
test where the reply is already sitting in the buffer, a non-blocking read
returns the data immediately and everything looks right — measured, **0 ms and
five bytes**. Over a real network the reply arrives a few milliseconds later
and the same code returns nothing.

`status()` is **1011**, timeout, for both "nothing yet" and "waited and gave
up". It does not distinguish them.

### TCP is a stream, not a message

Measured — ten bytes were written and read back in two pieces:

| | |
|---|---|
| `read.socket(s, 4, ...)` | `abcd` |
| `read.socket(s, 100, ...)` | `efghij` |

Nothing marks where one `write.socket` ended and the next began. **If your
protocol has messages, put a length or a terminator in them yourself** and keep
reading until you have a whole one.

### The bytes arrive exactly as sent

| | sent | received | identical |
|---|---|---|---|
| field, value and subvalue marks | 7 | 7 | **yes** |
| `char(0)`, `char(1)`, `char(255)` and a letter | 4 | 4 | **yes** |

A NUL does not terminate anything and a mark is not translated. A dynamic array
can go down a socket and come back as itself.

## SET.SOCKET.MODE

| Key | | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| `4` | blocking | set 0 → reads 0; set 1 → reads 1 |
| `5` | disable Nagle | set 1 → reads 1 |
| `6` | keep-alive | set 0 → reads 0; set 1 → reads 1 |
| anything else | | returns **0**, `status()` **1006** |

*(Key 6 could not be turned off in earlier builds of this port — the value you
passed was discarded, keep-alive was enabled whatever you asked for, and the
call reported success. **Fixed 26 Aug 2026 and re-measured**:
`set.socket.mode(s, 6, 0)` returns `1` and `socket.info(s, 6)` then reads `0`.)*

## When the far end goes away

```
close.socket cli
```

***THERE ARE TWO ANSWERS, NOT ONE, AND WHICH YOU GET DEPENDS ON WHICH END
CLOSED.*** Both were measured, in the same session:

| what closed | reading the other end gives |
|---|---|
| the **outgoing** socket closed, read the **accepted** one | nothing, `status()` **7013** |
| the **accepted** socket closed, read the **outgoing** one | nothing, `status()` **1008** |

7013 is `ER_SKT_CLOSED` — `recv()` returned zero, an orderly shutdown. 1008 is
`ER_FAILED` — `recv()` returned an error, and `os.error()` carries the
operating system's code. **A read loop must treat both as the end of the
conversation.** Testing only for 7013 is a loop that spins: measured, exactly
that guard ran its full 21 iterations against a closed socket and came back
with nothing every time.

Neither is 1011. An idle socket gives 1011 and may still have something to say.

`close.socket` is a statement and it **refuses anything that is not a socket**,
so do not call it on the zero that a failed `open.socket` returned.

## Names and addresses

```
addr = server.addr('localhost')
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `server.addr('127.0.0.1')` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `server.addr('localhost')` | ***`::1`*** |

***`localhost` RESOLVES TO THE IPv6 ADDRESS ON THIS PLATFORM.*** A program that
resolves `localhost` and then dials the answer is dialling IPv6, while
`create.server.socket('127.0.0.1', ...)` is listening on IPv4 — measured family
**1** — and the two do not meet. **Use `127.0.0.1` on both sides, or `::1` on
both sides, and do not resolve a name to get there.**

***AND A NAME THAT DOES NOT RESOLVE BLOCKS.*** `server.addr()` calls the
operating system resolver with no timeout of its own. Measured: a call for a
name that cannot resolve had still not returned after **45 seconds** and the
session had to be abandoned. There is no way to bound it from BASIC. **Do not
put `server.addr()` on a path where a user is waiting**, and prefer a
configured address to a name.

## A worked client, run rather than composed

This is the shape everything above adds up to. It was compiled and run with the
far end in the same session, answering in **three** pieces so that the
reassembly is exercised rather than assumed:

```
skt = open.socket(host, port, 0)
if socket.info(skt, 0) = 0 then
   crt 'no connection: ' : status()
   stop
end
x = set.socket.mode(skt, 4, 1)          ;* or every read returns at once
n = write.socket(skt, 'PING' : char(10), 0, 5000)

reply = ''
chunks = 0
loop
   chunk = read.socket(skt, 2048, 0, 5000)
   s = status()
   chunks += 1
   reply := chunk
until s = 7013 or s = 1008 or index(reply, char(10), 1) > 0 or chunks > 20
repeat
close.socket skt
```

Measured: `PON`, `G one` and a newline were sent as three separate writes and
the loop came back with **one** chunk containing `PONG one` and the terminator
at position 9, `status()` **0**. The `chunks > 20` arm is not decoration —
with the far end closed, the same loop guarded only by `s = 7013` ran all
twenty-one iterations, because that end reported **1008**.

**The terminator is yours, not TCP's.** Three writes arrived as one read here
and could just as easily arrive as three; the only reason the loop knows it is
finished is the newline it went looking for.

## What is not here

**`writepkt` is a restricted statement** — internal programs only. Measured, in
an ordinary account it is *"Unrecognised statement"*. It writes an SDClient
protocol packet and is not a general socket write.

**No TLS.** There is nothing in SD BASIC that speaks HTTPS; a socket carries
whatever bytes you put on it. Anything encrypted has to terminate outside SD.

**UDP and ICMP have flag values and were not exercised.** The whole of this page
is TCP; the `0x00010000` and `0x00020000` flags are named because they are in
the compiler, not because they were measured.

**A server that serves more than one client at a time** needs something to do
the waiting, and SD BASIC has no `select` over several sockets. The shape that
works is one accepted connection per session.
