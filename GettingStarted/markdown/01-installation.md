Title: Installing SD Core
Subtitle: What the installer does to the machine, the two kinds of installation, and what upgrading and uninstalling touch.

There is no compiler to run and no dependency to resolve. SD Core for Windows
ships as a single `sd-setup-W1.0-0.exe`, carries its own runtime beside
`sd.exe`, and installs in one pass.

This is the largest single difference from the regular SD version — that, and
the fact that this version is for Windows and not Linux. In regular SD,
`installsdai.sh` existed because ScarletDME targeted four distributions and the
end user had to compile; Windows has one target and one ABI, so none of that
transfers.

## Before you start

**You need an elevated session.** The installer creates local groups, sets
file permissions, registers a service and assigns user rights. You can start
the install from a normal console session — you will get an elevation prompt.

**SD cannot be installed silently.** This is deliberate, not a missing
feature. The installer asks questions whose answers cannot be defaulted safely
— which kind of installation, whether to expose ports, and the password on the
account it makes for you.

**The installer does not ask where to put SD.** Both roots are fixed. See
[What lands where](#what-lands-where).

### It checks the machine before it changes anything

The installer refuses to start, and changes nothing, if it finds:

- another ssh server using port 22, or
- an ssh service that is not part of Windows, installed even if it is not
  running, or
- Windows' own ssh server with settings somebody has already changed.

It tells you what it finds — the service and its path, or the directive that
was added — so you can decide what to do. You may **remove the other ssh
server, or put the ssh configuration back the way Windows shipped it, and run
the installer again.**

Why it is this strict: accounts SD creates cannot log in to Windows at all, so
ssh is one of only two ways they reach the machine — and SD configures the ssh
server so those sessions land inside SD and cannot reach a command prompt. **SD
can only promise that about a server it installed and configured itself.**

## What you are asked

There is one kind of installation. What varies is how the machine can be
reached afterwards, and that is three tick boxes on one page.

The boxes appear only on a **first** install. An upgrade shows no tasks page at
all: the machine already carries the answers, and every one of these settings
has a command that changes it afterwards.

### 1. System integration

| | Default |
|---|---|
| Add SD Core to the system PATH, so `sd` runs from any directory | **ticked** |

Changed afterwards with `append.sd.path on` or `off`.

### 2. The ssh server

**Installing an ssh server is optional, and the box is not ticked.** It
downloads from Windows Update and can take several minutes — up to about an
hour on a slow machine or connection — which is why it is offered rather than
done.

What you see depends on what the machine already has:

| Machine | Boxes | Defaults |
|---|---|---|
| No ssh server | *Install the OpenSSH server*, and indented under it *Let other computers connect* | both unticked |
| Server present, firewall shut | *Let other computers connect* | unticked |
| Server present, firewall open | *Let other computers connect* | **ticked** |

The second box is a child of the first, so Windows greys it out until the
parent is ticked. You cannot ask for remote ssh access without an ssh server.

The last row matters on a machine that already uses ssh: the box shows the
**current** firewall scope, so leaving it alone changes nothing in either
direction. `OpenSSH-Server-In-TCP` is Windows' own shared rule and not SD's, so
defaulting it to unticked and applying that would silently loopback-lock the
ssh a site already relies on.

Changed afterwards with `ssh.server install` or `remove`, and `remote.ssh on`
or `off`.

### 3. The API

| | Default |
|---|---|
| Provide the SD Core API (port 4243) | **unticked** |
| Let other computers on your network reach it | **unticked** |

**The API is off unless you ask for it.** Decline it and SD is installed with a
configuration carrying no `APIPORT` line, so no socket is opened at all — not a
listener behind a closed firewall, but no listener.

Again the second box is a child of the first. The pair appears only when there
is no existing configuration file to read the answer from.

Changed afterwards with `remote.api on`, `local` or `off`.

### An installation with neither is a supported choice

Leaving every remote box unticked gives a working SD that nothing outside the
machine can reach. That is a real deployment rather than a degraded one.

**Be aware of what it means for accounts.** Accounts SD creates are denied the
Windows console and Remote Desktop, so they reach SD over ssh or over the API
and nothing else — including at this keyboard, where an ssh account arrives by
`ssh localhost`. With no ssh server on the machine, `create.account … ssh` and
`… both` are refused, because the account could sign in nowhere. `api` and
`none` still work, and `none` is meaningful: an application account reached only
by `logto`.

The refusal is tested against the machine when you type the command, not
against a decision recorded at install time. Install an ssh server later and
`create.account … ssh` simply starts working.

## What lands where

| What | Where | Was, on Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Binaries, and the MSYS2 DLLs beside them | `C:\Program Files\SD\usr\bin\` | `/usr/local/bin` |
| The changelog | `C:\Program Files\SD\changelog` | — |
| Configuration | `C:\ProgramData\SD\sd.conf` | `/etc/sd.conf` |
| The SDSYS account | `C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys\` | `/usr/local/sdsys` |
| User accounts | `C:\ProgramData\SD\user_accounts\` | `/home/sd/user_accounts` |
| Group accounts | `C:\ProgramData\SD\group_accounts\` | `/home/sd/group_accounts` |
| POSIX shared memory | `C:\ProgramData\SD\shm\` | `/dev/shm` |

**`usr\bin` is load-bearing, not tidiness.** Shipping `msys-2.0.dll` beside the
executable relocates the POSIX root to the DLL's directory minus two
components, so only that depth puts `/` on `C:\Program Files\SD\`. Do not move
the binaries.

**The DLLs ship beside `sd.exe` on purpose.** Do not change their location.

### Configuration

Server and client both read `SD_CONFIG`, then fall back to
`%ProgramData%\SD\sd.conf`.

`sd.conf` is installed `onlyifdoesntexist` and marked never to uninstall, so
your edits survive both upgrade and removal.

## What the installer creates on the machine

| | |
|---|---|
| `sdusers` | grants access to the files under `C:\ProgramData\SD`. Everyone who uses SD needs it |
| `sdsshonly` | carries the two deny rights that confine an account to ssh. Every non-administrator account SD creates joins it |
| `sdu_<name>` | one per account, created by **`create.account`** |
| the service | **String Database (SD)** |
| ACLs | inheritance is broken on `C:\ProgramData\SD` and access granted narrowly. This is what makes the database private from the rest of the machine |

**You must sign out and back in after being added to `sdusers`.** Windows
group membership is carried in your logon token. Until you get a new one, you
cannot read the data tree at all, and the symptom looks like a broken install.

## OpenSSH

**The OpenSSH server is installed only if you ask for it**, and the box is not
ticked. This section covers what happens when you do ask.

Accounts SD creates cannot log in to Windows, so they reach the machine over
ssh or through an API client. An installation offering neither is usable by
nobody but you — which is a legitimate choice, and worth making knowingly. A
local-only machine is served by `ssh localhost`, which needs no network.

**It is slow and it looks like a hang.** `Add-WindowsCapability` hands off to
`TiWorker` and can work for minutes with nothing on screen. **Never kill it** —
interrupting Windows servicing mid-flight is how the component store gets
corrupted. It may also leave a reboot pending, which is real; SD itself needs
none.

**If it cannot be installed, the install still succeeds.** It is a Features on
Demand capability and can be blocked by policy, a WSUS with no source, a
metered connection or an offline machine. The installer reports it in as many
words, with the command to retry — and you should read that report, because in
that state **no account but yours can sign in anywhere.**

It is the same command either way, and it is repeated here because the closing
report is easy to close. From an elevated prompt:

```
powershell -File "C:\Program Files\SD\install-ssh.ps1"
```

It exits **0** installed and running, **2** installed but Windows wants a
restart before the service exists, **1** failed — and it prints which, so run
it in a window you can read rather than expecting a log. It is safe to run
twice: on a machine that already has the server it says so and changes
nothing.

## The full-screen editors

**The installer makes sure the two terminal editors are on the machine**,
because the **`edit`** and **`micro`** verbs run them. Current Windows builds
already carry `edit.exe`; micro never ships with Windows, so it is always a
winget install. Neither is offered as a choice, for the same reason the ssh
server is not: a programmer account with a verb that does nothing is worse
than either answer.

**If one cannot be installed, the install still succeeds.** No winget, no
network or a policy in the way all end the same: SD is complete and one editor
verb is not — **`ed`**, the line editor, needs nothing. What happened is in
`C:\ProgramData\SD\install-editors.log`, and to do it by hand afterwards,
from an elevated prompt:

```
winget install -e --id Microsoft.Edit --scope machine
winget install -e --id zyedidia.micro --scope machine
```

**The scope is not optional.** Without it winget installs into the profile of
whoever ran it, and accounts SD creates cannot log in to Windows at all — so a
per-user copy is one they can never reach.

## Changing any of it afterwards

Every choice on the tasks page has a verb that changes it later, and that is
why an upgrade does not ask again. All four need an elevated administrator
session, and all four report when given no keyword:

| | |
|---|---|
| `ssh.server install` \| `remove` | add or remove the OpenSSH server |
| `remote.ssh on` \| `off` | who may reach it |
| `remote.api on` \| `local` \| `off` | whether SD opens its API socket, and who may reach it |
| `append.sd.path on` \| `off` | whether `sd` runs from any directory |

They are covered in the SD Core for Windows administrator documentation, under
*Remote access and the machine*.

`remote.api on` and `off` change whether SD opens a socket at all, which it
decides at start-up, so they offer to restart SD — and that restart ends every
session including the one that asked. `local` and `on` differ only in the
firewall and take effect at once.

The underlying scripts are still on the machine and can be run directly if you
prefer, from an elevated prompt:

```
powershell -File "C:\Program Files\SD\api-firewall.ps1" -Open
```

## At the end

The installer **finishes, and then opens SD** so you can set your own password.
It does not leave a wizard page waiting behind the session.

A Start Menu entry, **Check the SD installation**, runs a post-install check
you can re-run at any time. It closes on a keypress.

You are told plainly what setting no password costs, rather than being allowed
to skip past it silently.

## Upgrading

**Installing a new release over an existing one updates your database.**

| Replaced | Kept, and not touched |
|---|---|
| the catalogue and compiled programs | your accounts and their passwords |
| the BASIC source | the private catalogue |
| the messages and include records | which Windows users are linked to which SD accounts |
| the VOC templates and library routines | the commands each account may run |
| the SDSYS `BP` programs | your print queue and held reports |
| terminfo, the licence, the contributor list | everything under your own accounts, and `sd.conf` |

Anything SD created while it was running — your VOC included — is left exactly
as it is.

**The dictionaries are brought up to date for you.** Upgrading reapplies the
dictionary definitions the release ships: it adds and updates the entries SD
ships and leaves alone any you added. If that step cannot run, the installer
says so at the end rather than finishing quietly, and `upgrade-dicts.log` in
`C:\ProgramData\SD` says what happened.

**Every account's VOC is brought up to date for you.** The installer runs
`update.accounts all`, which walks every registered account, so a command this
release adds can be typed in accounts that already existed. This did not happen
before W1.0-0: an upgrade replaced the shipped files and no existing account —
including the system account — ever gained a new verb.

To refresh one account by hand afterwards, `update.accounts` in that account
updates it and offers the rest.

Two limits are worth knowing before you rely on it.

> **SD only ever adds records to a VOC, never removes them.** An account created
> before a verb was withdrawn keeps it. `update.accounts` cannot be relied on to
> take something away.

> **A record you have customised can be held back on purpose.** Put `[locked]`
> in field 1 after the type code and the upgrade leaves that record alone,
> naming it in a message so you know what was withheld — and therefore which
> corrections this release made that you have not taken. Verbs are the
> exception: a locked verb is updated anyway, and you are told which. The
> administrator documentation covers it under *Accounts and security*.

## Uninstalling

It is the standard Windows uninstall — Settings ▸ Apps, or `unins000.exe`.

**The default does not touch your accounts, the database or the
configuration.** Inno removes only what it installed and only removes a
directory if it is empty, so everything the running system created is invisible
to it.

**Removing the data is a separate, opt-in prompt** that defaults to keeping it,
and says exactly what it destroys and where. **A silent uninstall never
deletes the database**, whatever the prompt would have offered.

**The uninstaller does not remove OpenSSH.** It may predate SD or be in use by
something else. It does restore `sshd_config`, keeping the original as
`sshd_config.before-sd` — but it deliberately does **not** widen the firewall
rule back, because restoring it would mean opening a port on the way out.
