Title: ssh access
Subtitle: How people reach SD on this machine, why it is ssh, and the one thing it costs you.

**Accounts SD creates cannot log in to Windows at this machine.** They are
denied the physical console and Remote Desktop, deliberately and by group
membership. Local terminal access belongs to administrators, who have ordinary
Windows accounts.

**They reach SD over ssh, or through an API client, or both.** Which of those
an account may use is chosen when it is created and is a required keyword — see
[Per-account control](#per-account-control) below. This page covers the ssh
route; [API access](09-api-access.html) covers the other.

This has no equivalent in OpenQM or in SD on Linux, and it shapes almost
everything else about running SD Core on Windows.

## The rule, and the one exception

| | `create.account user x` | `create.account user x administrator` |
|---|---|---|
| Windows group | standard user | `Administrators` |
| Administers SD | no | yes |
| Local console / Remote Desktop | **denied** | allowed |
| ssh | if granted | yes |
| API | if granted | yes |

**"Denied the console" is about logging in to Windows, not about reaching
sd.** An account with `api` and no `ssh` is a perfectly normal thing to
create — a person using a custom GUI client that talks to SD does not need a
terminal session at all.

**Multi-user access over remote Desktop is not supported.** This is not an
oversight and not a gap to be filled later. One Windows setting covers Remote
Desktop and the physical keyboard together, so an account allowed to use RDP
could also walk up to the machine and log in — which was never the intention. A
verb that lifted the restriction (`RDPACCOUNT`) was built and deleted the next
day for exactly that reason.

**The rule that now holds without exception:** nobody SD creates can log in to
Windows at this machine unless they are already a Windows administrator. **SD
accounts reach the machine over ssh or through an API client.**

If you want multi-user Remote Desktop, you want Windows Server and RDP client
access licences, and probably a commercial product built for it.

## How it is done

Two Windows user rights, applied **to a group, once** — not per account:

| | |
|---|---|
| `SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight` | blocks the physical console |
| `SeDenyRemoteInteractiveLogonRight` | blocks Remote Desktop |

Both are on the group `sdsshonly`, and **`create.account`** joins every
non-administrator account to it.

**Network logon is not denied, and must not be.** Win32-OpenSSH
authenticates with a network logon — cleartext network logon for passwords, S4U
for public keys — so denying it would lock out the very access this exists to
preserve. **This is the trap in the design and it is the one thing to get
right.**

**It cannot be `sdusers`.** That group grants access to the data files and
administrators are in it too, so denying console logon there would lock
administrators out of their own console. The two groups answer different
questions and must stay separate.

## An ssh session lands inside SD

`sshd_config` carries a global `ForceCommand`, so signing in over ssh puts you
straight into SD rather than at a Windows prompt.

**That applies to everyone who may connect, administrators included** — the
rule is about the route in, not about who took it.

### The cost: scp and sftp stop working inbound

**NO FILE CAN BE PUSHED TO THIS MACHINE OVER ssh, BY ANYBODY, ADMINISTRATORS
INCLUDED.** The command is forced, so there is no file-transfer subsystem left
to run. This is deliberate and is the accepted cost of the above.

**The cost is INBOUND ONLY, and that is the whole of the answer.**
`ForceCommand` applies to sessions where this machine is the ssh *server*.
WinSCP or `scp` running **on** this machine, connecting outward, makes it the
*client*, and `sshd_config` is not consulted at all.

**So copy files by Pulling them, not pushing them.** Sit at the machine or
connect with Remote Desktop — both untouched, because administrators are never
put in `sdsshonly` — and fetch what you need from there. Outbound connections
are not firewalled.

Remote-control tools that copy files are unaffected, and so are the console and
Remote Desktop.

> takes the **first** obtained value for a keyword, and SD's block is inserted

> override the earlier global one. Pulling avoids the question entirely.

## Who may ssh in at all

`AllowGroups` in `sshd_config` is the second layer: the deny rights stop local
logon, `AllowGroups` decides who may connect.

**THE "Limit ssh" CHECKBOX IS GONE. IT IS NOW A STATEMENT.** SD limits ssh to
SD users and administrators and puts every ssh session straight into SD. It had
been ticked by default for some time and was not really meant to be turned off,
so presenting it as a checkbox suggested a choice that was not one. It is
described on the *Before you install* page instead, with the scp cost stated
plainly.

The reason it can no longer be declined is that the machine it existed for —
one with somebody else's ssh server — is now [turned away before the install
starts](01-installation.html#it-checks-the-machine-before-it-changes-anything).

**Your existing `sshd_config` is kept as `sshd_config.before-sd`, and
uninstalling SD puts it back.**

### If SD did not install your ssh server

SD never reconfigures or restarts an ssh server it did not install — it may be
managed by policy. On such a machine, apply the confinement yourself, once,
from an elevated prompt:

```
powershell -File "C:\Program Files\SD\allow-ssh-groups.ps1" -Installed
```

It checks the result with `sshd -T` and puts the original back if anything is
wrong, keeping a copy as `sshd_config.before-sd`.

It also **refuses outright** if `sshd_config` already carries an `AllowGroups`,
`AllowUsers`, `DenyGroups` or `DenyUsers` line — that is somebody's policy and
it is left alone.

## Reaching the machine from the network

**Port 22 is closed to other computers unless you tick the box during
installation.** The rule is scoped to `127.0.0.1,::1` otherwise.

> **IF YOU INSTALLED A BUILD BEFORE 25 Aug 2026, CHECK THIS.** The narrowing
> step failed **every single time it ran**, leaving port 22 open to the local
> network even when the box was unticked. The installer's closing page said so:
> *"Setting who may reach ssh FAILED, and Windows' own default is in force —
> port 22 open to your local network."* The recovery command it offered failed
> for the same reason. Only machines where SD installed ssh itself are
> affected. Fix it with:
>
> ```
> powershell -File "C:\Program Files\SD\ssh-firewall.ps1" -Installed -Restrict
> ```
>
> It now reports *"ssh is reachable FROM THIS MACHINE ONLY"*. Check the current
> setting with `-Show`, or look at the rule **OpenSSH SSH Server (sshd)** in
> `wf.msc`.

**Connecting to SD on your own machine is unaffected**, over IPv4 and IPv6
alike — Windows does not filter traffic that never leaves the machine, so
`ssh localhost` keeps working whichever way the setting is left. **A local-only
installation is served entirely by `ssh localhost`.**

## Per-account control

An account is told at creation which routes it may use, and one of the four
keywords is required:

| | reaches SD by |
|---|---|
| `create.account user fred ssh` | a terminal session over ssh |
| `create.account user fred api` | **an API client only** — no terminal, and nothing on this page applies to them |
| `create.account user fred both` | either |
| `create.account user fred none` | neither — reachable only with **`logto`** from another session |

**An `api` account never touches any of this.** No ssh session, no
`ForceCommand`, no port 22. For people running a GUI client against SD, that is
the account shape they want, and the ssh configuration on this page does not
apply to them.

`modify.account fred both` changes it afterwards — and remember the keyword
says what the access **is**, not what to add, so `modify.account fred api`
takes ssh away. Administrators always have both. See
[Account types](05-account-types.html).

**A suspended account is refused after the connection is made, not before.**
`modify.account fred suspended` does not touch the `sdssh` group, so sshd still
accepts Fred's connection and SD still starts — and then refuses him:

```
Account FRED is suspended
```

**A suspension is an SD control, not a network one.** That is what makes
lifting it free: nothing was withdrawn, so nothing has to be restored. If you
need the connection itself refused, take the account out of `sdssh` too with
`modify.account fred none` — and remember you must then put it back by hand.

## What ssh-only does not mean

**The deny rights control *where* an account may log in, not *what it may
run*.** Confining a user to SD rather than to a shell is the separate
`ForceCommand` control above, and reaching the operating system from inside SD
is the separate `os.users` permit list — see
[Administrator commands](06-administrator-commands.html#the-shell-escapes-sh-and).

**And ssh-only does not give users isolation from each other's data.** Every SD
process opens the database under the invoking user's own token, so everyone who
uses SD needs file access to the tree and can read another account's directory
from outside SD. See [Security](12-security.html).

## One measured caution about remote administration

`LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` is not set by SD, so the Windows default UAC
remote restriction applies: a local account logging on over the network gets a
**filtered** token. An SD administrator arriving over ssh may therefore be
unable to elevate, and so unable to reach SDSYS remotely.

**Nobody gets extra access — the failure is that an administrator gets less.**
It has not been measured, so do not rely on remote administration until you
have tried it on your own machine. It may simply be the design: the console and
Remote Desktop belong to administrators, and ssh is for everyone else.
