Title: Managing accounts
Subtitle: Group accounts, sharing one, changing an account afterwards, and deleting it.

This page continues [Account types](05-account-types.html).

## Group accounts

A group account is a shared workspace with **no Windows account and no sign-in
of its own**. It is how you keep separate work separate, and it is the one kind
of account that needs no way in from outside — which makes it the only extra
account available on a machine with no ssh server and no API.

```
create.account group payroll
modify.account add payroll fred
```

Reach it with `logto payroll`, or through an F pointer. On a machine with no
remote access at all, **`logto`** into a group account from a session run as
administrator.

## Sharing a user account

```
grant   <account> to   <user>
revoke  <account> from <user>
list.grants <account>
```

All three need an elevated session, and say so rather than failing obscurely.

**Read this twice, because it is the most confusing part of how SD controls
access.** Entry to an account is membership of the Windows group named in the
account's record, and **Windows fixes group membership when you sign in**. So:

- a grant does not reach the person until they sign out of Windows and back in;
- and **somebody you have just revoked keeps the account until they do the
  same.**

Both verbs print that reminder every time.

**`list.grants`** also shows the account's own user, which is always there and is
not a grant. It is listed anyway so that what you see matches the Windows group
it is reporting.

> The old field 4 of an `ACCOUNTS` record — a list of accounts allowed in — has
> been removed, and `list accounts` no longer shows a *Granted to* column.
> **`list.grants`** answers that question now.

> **`list accounts` shows the tier, and its columns have changed.** The
> default is `Account`, `Pathname`, `Description`, `Tier`. The Windows group
> came out to make room: it is always `sdu_` or `sdg_` followed by the account
> name, so it told you nothing the id did not. Both are still there by name —
> `list accounts path descr group tier`. **`Was` is the tier a suspension
> displaced**, and it is empty on an account that is not suspended.
>
> From an ordinary account the register is reached as `sd.accounts`, not
> `accounts` — `list sd.accounts`, `ct sd.accounts fred`.

## Changing an account afterwards

```
modify.account <name> <standard | programmer | administrator | suspended>
modify.account <name> <ssh | api | both | none>
modify.account <name> <sh-on | sh-off | os-on | os-off>
modify.account add <group> <user>
modify.password {<account>}
```

All of them need an elevated session.

### The tier

**The tier moves in either direction and needs no intermediate step.** An
account can go programmer, standard, suspended and back to any of them
directly. Naming a tier on a suspended account lifts the suspension into that
tier — **there is no `resume` keyword**; coming back always says where to.

**The VOC is rebuilt there and then**, not at the next login, and the verb says
what it did:

```
:modify.account fred standard
Account FRED is now STANDARD
VOC: 0 records added, 42 removed, 0 left alone
```

**"Left alone" is the count to read.** A record is only removed if it is
still exactly what SD put there. **Anything you or the account's owner has
edited is counted and kept** — it is somebody's work under a verb's name rather
than the verb, and a downgrade will not destroy it.

### Leaving `administrator` takes three things, and you must name one

| | |
|---|---|
| Windows `Administrators` membership | removed for you |
| the `os.users` record | removed for you |
| ssh and the API | **you say** |

The first two were the account's *because* it was an administrator. ssh and the
API are a rule for an administrator and a setting for everybody else, so the
command will not guess:

```
:modify.account fred programmer
Say what remote access FRED is to have: ssh, api, both or none
:modify.account fred programmer both
FRED may sign in over ssh and use the API
Account FRED is now PROGRAMMER
```

**You cannot suspend your own account, or the one you are standing in.** And a
group account can be any tier except `administrator` — there is no single
person behind it to put in a Windows group.

### The remote routes

**The keyword says what the access is, not what to add.** So

```
modify.account fred api
```

gives Fred the API **and takes ssh away**. If you want both, say `both`. The
message afterwards always names both routes, so you can see what you have left
him with.

### Reaching the operating system

`sh-on`, `sh-off`, `os-on` and `os-off` set the two fields of the person's
`os.users` record without your having to edit it by hand — field 1 is the
**`sh`** verb, field 2 is `OS.EXECUTE` and the two full-screen editors. See
[Administrator commands](06-administrator-commands.html#the-list).

**These four are switches, not names for one state**, unlike the tier and the
routes above — so `sh-off` leaves `OS.EXECUTE` alone.

### What refuses on an administrator's account

**All three of ssh, the API and the operating system.** An administrator has
every route as a rule, and none of them is this verb's to change:

```
:modify.account don os-off
don is an administrator and always reaches the operating system
```

**Downgrade the account first** if that is really what you want. The tier is
the only thing about an administrator that `modify.account` will change.

**But the routes are local only, and that is not something you set.** An
administrator keeps ssh and the API for good, and both stop at this computer:
a sign-in from anywhere else is refused, whatever the account record says.

> An administrator may not sign in to this machine from another one.

Administration happens at the console, or through a remote desktop or
remote-control product installed as a service. Ordinary and programmer accounts
are not affected — their routes work from other machines exactly as before.

**`set.password` is now `modify.password`.** Same verb, same behaviour; the
name changed because every account has a password from the moment it is made,
so there is nothing to *set* for the first time.

## Deleting an account

**`delete.account`** **asks once, then removes everything.** The single question
names exactly what will go, including the Windows account when there is one to
remove.

**It will not delete a Windows account SD did not create.** The question uses
shorter wording in that case rather than promising something it will not do.

## Two things that catch people out

**1. `update.accounts` never takes a verb away.** SD only ever *adds* records to
a VOC at an update. An account created before a verb was withdrawn keeps it, and
running **`update.accounts`** will not remove it.

**`modify.account <tier>` is the one that does remove them**, and it is the only
thing that ever will. If you need a verb gone from an account, change the tier;
`update.accounts` will not undo it afterwards either, because the tier is
recorded and every update applies it.

**2. `sdusers` membership needs a fresh logon.** Same reason as grants. After
being added to the group, sign out of Windows and back in, or you cannot read
the data tree at all — and the symptom looks like a broken install rather than
a permissions problem.
