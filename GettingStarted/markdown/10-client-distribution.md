Title: Client distribution
Subtitle: Which library an application needs, why there are four names, and the one file no installer can update.

An application reaches SD Core through a client DLL. **You do not have to find
it inside an installed SD system** — the clients are packaged separately, with
their own installers, because the person writing an application and the person
running the server are usually not the same person.

## The four names, and why

Two builds, each producing its DLL under **two names from one source in one
build**:

| Build | Names | For |
|---|---|---|
| 64-bit | `sdclilib.dll` · `sdclient.dll` | new work, and existing SD applications |
| 32-bit | `qmclilib.dll` · `qmclient.dll` | QM applications, and **mvDeveloper** |

**The `*clilib` names are what existing applications ask for and they never
move.** `qmclilib.dll` in particular is the original QMClient library name —
it is **how an unmodified QM application finds its client at all**, so it is a
name rather than a label and it is not going to be renamed.

The `*client` names are for new work and are what the installers put on `PATH`.

> They are second **links**, not file copies. An import library records the DLL
> name its symbols come from, so a renamed copy would send the application back
> to the original.

## Both builds come from one source

`sd4windows\sdb_ai\sd64\gplsrc\sdclilib` is the single source of truth. The
32-bit build points straight at it.

**There is deliberately no second copy.** An earlier build of this port had a
middle hop, and it let the 32-bit DLL go stale and **ship without SCRAM** —
sending passwords in clear against a server that no longer accepted them. The
hop was removed.

**If you are testing the 32-bit client, confirm which build you have.** A
client that predates SCRAM is refused outright by this server, and the refusal
reads as a wrong password.

## Which one does my application need?

| | |
|---|---|
| A 64-bit application | `sdclient.dll`, or `sdclilib.dll` if it already asks for that name |
| A 32-bit application | `qmclient.dll`, or `qmclilib.dll` if it already asks for that name |
| **mvDeveloper** | `qmclilib.dll`, 32-bit — and see the warning below |

**The architecture must match the application, not the machine.** A 32-bit
application on 64-bit Windows needs the 32-bit DLL. **The 32-bit build is a
shipping deliverable, not a testing convenience.**

## The one file no installer can update

**mvDeveloper is free, and is a 32-bit application** —
<https://www.brianleach.co.uk/mvDeveloper>.

**It loads its own copy of the client**, from:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\BLC\mvDeveloper\qmclilib.dll
```

That is **beside the executable, and Windows searches an executable's own
directory before `PATH`** — so no installer entry and no `PATH` change will
ever update it. It has to be replaced by hand.

**This is the most likely way to test an old client without realising it.**
If mvDeveloper cannot log in after an upgrade, check that file's date before
anything else.

## The library must match the release

**The cleartext API login is gone.** A client that still sends a password in
clear is refused with *"Cleartext login is no longer supported; this server
requires SCRAM authentication"*.

Two things to do, and the second is the one people miss:

1. Use a client library from this release or later.
2. **Run `modify.password` again for every account that uses the API.** The
   stored credentials changed shape and the old ones cannot be converted — the
   password was never kept anywhere, by design, so there is nothing to convert
   them from.

An account whose password has not been re-set is refused, **and the refusal
reads as a wrong password**, because from the server's point of view there is
no credential to check.

## Connecting

Your application code does not change. `SDConnect()` and `SDConnectLocal()`
take the same arguments and return the same things they always did.

| | |
|---|---|
| `SDConnect()` | over the network, to port **4243** — not an ssh tunnel any more |
| `SDConnectLocal()` | on the same machine. **Sends no password and never did**, so SCRAM does not apply |

BASIC programs reaching another SD server use the `!sdclient` class, which
speaks the new login too — `connect()` takes the same arguments, but **the
program has to be running under this release at both ends.**

Everything about what a connected session may open, the three gates it must
clear, and the identity it runs as is on [API access](09-api-access.html).

## Building from source

**There is one repository and it builds all four DLLs**:
<https://github.com/dmontaine/sd4windows>. The client source is in it, at
`sdb_ai/sd64/gplsrc/sdclilib`, and `make sd` produces the 64-bit and 32-bit
pairs together with the server. **No built DLL is committed**, so a clone
builds — the same no-binaries rule the whole repository follows.

> **This changed on 4 September 2026 and earlier versions of this page said
> otherwise.** The clients used to live in two repositories of their own, each
> building its own DLL and carrying its own Inno installer. They were retired
> because keeping a mirror in step by hand had gone wrong in the worst
> available way: the 32-bit client was built from a copy that had not been
> updated in over two weeks and **shipped sending passwords in clear**, with
> nothing in either project able to notice. One source that cannot diverge
> beats a check that reports divergence. **If you are looking for
> `winsdclilib` or `sdclilib32`, that is why you cannot find them.**

### Where the built clients are after an install

The server installer places them under `C:\Program Files\SD`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `usr\clients\client64\` | `sdclilib.dll`, `sdclient.dll`, and the import libraries to link against |
| `usr\clients\client32\` | `qmclilib.dll`, `qmclient.dll`, and their import libraries |
| `usr\bin\` | **both** DLL pairs again, beside `sd.exe`. That directory is on `PATH`, so it is where a 32-bit utility finds its client at run time |

**The C headers are not shipped yet.** Take them from the repository.

> **A note on how the 32-bit client is built, because it constrains changes to
> it:** the DLL must stay a **single self-contained file that can be copied
> next to an application** — hence static linking of the compiler runtime, and
> hence a preference for Windows' own `bcrypt.dll` and `crypt32.dll` over
> third-party crypto libraries. Any change to the client has to keep working in
> a 32-bit process.

## How the clients will be published

**THERE WILL BE A CLIENT INSTALLER OF ITS OWN, AND IT WILL CARRY MORE THAN THE
DLLs.**

| | |
|---|---|
| In it | the client DLLs, this documentation, and the related utilities |
| Not in it | source code of any kind |
| Where the source is | GitHub only — <https://github.com/dmontaine/sd4windows>. The installer creates a `docs` subdirectory and names the repository there |

**That installer is not what W1.0-0 ships.** It is a change to the installer
and it has not been made yet. What exists today is what the section above
describes: the server installer builds and places all four DLLs, and there is
no client-only package.

**So if you need a client and cannot find one, ask rather than building from
source** — the answer may be that a package is waiting.
